1|amazon|pros|You're surrounded by smart people and the projects are interesting, if a little daunting.
1|amazon|cons|Internal tools proliferation has created a mess for trying to get to basic information. Most people are required to learn/understand SQL Database queries to get any actionable data.
2|amazon|pros|Brand name is great. Have yet to meet somebody who is unfamiliar with Amazon. Hours weren't as bad as I had previously heard. But i guess can be long for corporate finance
2|amazon|cons|not the most stimulating work. Good brand name to work for but the work itself is mundane as it can get. As a financial analyst you do very little finance.
3|amazon|pros|Good money.Interaction with some great minds in the world during internal conferences and sessions.Of course the pride of being a part of earth's most customer centric experience
3|amazon|cons|No proper growth plan for employees.Difficult promotion process requiring a lot more documentation than your actual deliverable.
4|amazon|pros|nice pay and overtime and different shifts
4|amazon|cons|didn't last quite long enough
5|amazon|pros|Opportunity for those not afraid to work!
5|amazon|cons|Opportunity takes time up to two plus years!
6|amazon|pros|Pay was good, benefits from day one, meet a lot of new people, a lot of fun contests, and great giveaways. They keep you hydrated with the endless water supply
6|amazon|cons|Long hours with only two 15 minute breaks and half hour lunch, so to have to stand on concrete without being able to sit is hard. Good luck trying to get the days that work for your life when you start. They tell you what days yo have to work. Either except it or move on. Do not get sick while working there. People have gotten fired for fainting at work. If you aren't fast enough to make a ridiculously high rate, the??Show More
7|amazon|pros|Got to meet some decent people from jersey, when it's a little warmer out its nice ride from philly to jersey
7|amazon|cons|the hours are too long, you have to stand up the whole shift, you can't bring your phone in, there's no entertainment to keep you focused, it's always freezing, it's way too loud, the breaks are too short
8|amazon|pros|The salary is good for the work involved. They offer stock however only after a year of employment at the company.
8|amazon|cons|Management and Human Resources do not communicate to floor employees. The culture there seems to adhere to a he said/she said and if you are young and inexperienced in the work environment you will be wrong and targeted. There is no growing in this company even if promises are made. I do not recommend this company if you are a first time employee especially since they take no part in grooming you or helping you. They??Show More
9|amazon|pros|Great company, great people. One of the biggest benefits is being able to reference Amazon as a recent workplace on your resume.
9|amazon|cons|For being such a prestigious company, the benefits were very average.
10|amazon|pros|Not too intense. Lots of outdoor activities during. The people are nice. Everyone is assigned a mentor. The salary was good as well.
10|amazon|cons|It was not a very interesting project. The challenge was more on the operational side instead of in the research side. Do not allow publication.
11|amazon|pros|Decent pay, but there are far better opportunities in the area
11|amazon|cons|Management is very poor
12|amazon|pros|Co-workers and management teams were generally upbeat, and it was easy to get help when you needed it most. This was a work at home position, and the hours were steady.
12|amazon|cons|Plenty of IT issues, lack of compassion from the higher ups, and somewhat a lack of ambition from some of the management staff
13|amazon|pros|good benefits, guaranteed 40hrs a week, paid time off , ect
13|amazon|cons|mandatory overtime at random times, over worked for not much pay, have to use paid time or un paid time on overtime days
14|amazon|pros|you get a great pay and it helps you out with getting other cleaning jobs
14|amazon|cons|after a while it gets boring
15|amazon|pros|Great pay. Great people. Great.
15|amazon|cons|Too hard. Too much standing.
16|amazon|pros|Great chances for promotions. The company is growing fast year after year. You can get a promotion every year. You work hard but play hard as well. They take good care of each other.
16|amazon|cons|Like most retail jobs the hours can be very long. Especially during the holiday season.
17|amazon|pros|Fun working environment, challenging, lots of people to interact with, lots of overtime bumps your pay way higher than the estimated (up to $25,000+ a year), typically get 3 day weekend unless it's the holiday season.
17|amazon|cons|Long working days (no more than 12hrs/day), lots to remember, pressure can build up for short periods of time.
18|amazon|pros|The people are great too work around and they try to fix all situations
18|amazon|cons|A little unorganized but nothing thst can't be fixed
19|amazon|pros|Very productive learning experience, and great company to start your career
19|amazon|cons|No work life balance for software engineers
20|amazon|pros|lots of over time.. make great money
20|amazon|cons|managers expect workers to work like robots and achieve high rates. lots of favortism
21|amazon|pros|I have fantastic support and training. Help is only a chat away. Our team stays connected in a team chat. And individual conversations with leadership are easily accomplished. I feel appreciated and valued working here. Time off and schedule changes are easy to arrange as well. Skill building and training are ongoing there is usually opportunity for additional hours. There are a host of skill sets to be trained in an??Show More
21|amazon|cons|The first two training weeks are long days and information overload! It may take a bit before you hit your groove of feeling confident in your role. A performance summary offers metrics of how you are doing based on customer response re: solving their issue. When something takes multiple steps and you couldn't solve their issue immediately this metric will count against you. They do look at general improvement trends??Show More
22|amazon|pros|I had a fun time do business with and will continue to do so in the future I would recommend it to anyone
22|amazon|cons|I did see any bad about Amazon I had a wonderful time and it was a true blessing to have found a place like Amazon
23|amazon|pros|If you are not willing to work hard, then this is not for you
23|amazon|cons|Difficult to change shift .......................
24|amazon|pros|Everything is great. This is a great company to work for with great people. You'll love it here! Go now!
24|amazon|cons|Nothing! The people are great, customers can be cranky and rude, but other than that it's a great place to work.
25|amazon|pros|Great hours, able to work from home, awesome benefits for anyone that sells a lot of items through them.
25|amazon|cons|There really weren't any the whole time I worked with them
26|amazon|pros|None It was the harshest place I have ever worked where the employee had no value
26|amazon|cons|Dont care about emploies period. Bottom line is the ONLY THING THET MATTERS!!!!! tHhe turn over rate is probably thre highest any where
27|amazon|pros|You get promoted by chatting with people and doing nothing important.
27|amazon|cons|Operations managers don't know what they are doing.
28|amazon|pros|Great company , lots of benifits, would not change working here for anything, they are doing alot of hiring. Many locations throughout the country. Constantly hiring
28|amazon|cons|There are not really any cons, people here complain but why complain in a warehouse job. The public really outs us like it's a bad company. Love it l.
29|amazon|pros|great work environment ,some times
29|amazon|cons|high turnover ratio,all the time
30|amazon|pros|Amazon has great benefits and the pay was okay especially since we were guaranteed overtime. Management was relaxed and they didnt micromanage. You just had to make sure you were performing.
30|amazon|cons|Standing and lifting for 10-12 hours a day.
31|amazon|pros|Working at Amazon is great during peak season. It was a great experience because of the diversity there was.
31|amazon|cons|If you aren't in shape it gets tough and you just become physically and mentally exhausted. It is a lot of walking.
32|amazon|pros|Nice benefits, good hours, good pay
32|amazon|cons|Young leadership, no communicaton between leadership and associates
33|amazon|pros|Benefits are outstanding. Co workers excluding management are outstanding.
33|amazon|cons|They tend to hire leadership straight out of college who lack any ounce of people skills. They eventually get thrown to the wolves in Which they have to survive in their own with their superiors breathing down their necks, trying to meet unattainable goals. They eventually put all common sense aside and ask too much of there associates. It's no fault of their own, but forget that the monetary benifit from their emplo??Show More
34|amazon|pros|Ignore the news article from recent NY Times on Amazon's terrible work culture. I have been working here since 2012 and yes the first few months was hard in terms of understanding how. what and when to get things done. But once i figured out pace, what really matters and dove in I loved going to work everyday and do what I do.
34|amazon|cons|Frugality - though this is one of Amazon's Leadership Principles I think it is because of this employees compare perks, benefits and simple things like working lunch meets and put the company in negative light.
35|amazon|pros|Good pay and Great hours
35|amazon|cons|Rates you on performance daily
36|amazon|pros|Good work and life balance
36|amazon|cons|Workload is quite a lot for individual as one employee.
37|amazon|pros|big company lots of options / teams
37|amazon|cons|young inexperienced managers
38|amazon|pros|Great experience working this job
38|amazon|cons|hours too long n need more raises
39|amazon|pros|Benefits And Insurance Advancement Growth
39|amazon|cons|12.50 and hour heavy work long hours
40|amazon|pros|*You get to have Amazon on your resume
40|amazon|cons|*Middle management treat you terribly, upper management and associates have been very nice and hard working but middle management are entitled, rude and borderline abusive.
41|amazon|pros|High visibility/impact.
41|amazon|cons|Very tedious work; almost no innovation.
42|amazon|pros|Great place to work with many great benefits.
42|amazon|cons|Poor internal promotions. People from the outside coming in will make more than someone that already knows the job.
43|amazon|pros|Good pay. Well organized company. Great benefits. I worked at a warehouse in the inbound side. They showed me how to operate a forklift and gained a lot of experience on how a warehouse works. 3 days off.
43|amazon|cons|Long hours! 10 hour shifts. Very boring depending on what your job is. No music or phones allowed. Very strict on lunches and breaks. Management is HORRIBLE at communicating with other managers or supervisors. This makes any projects very frustrating for everyone. Amazon will hire a college student straight out of school with NO experience in warehousing and place him as manager.
44|amazon|pros|They take very good care of their employees and I do miss working there. Always a good schedule and two thumbs up
44|amazon|cons|The only downside was being given so little hours. I would have liked to work a few more days a week.
45|amazon|pros|Good hours, decent pay, work from home, Great managers
45|amazon|cons|Customer service has it's cons. Cant ever go a day without having a rude customer calling in demanding things and ruining your day.
46|amazon|pros|Compensation and benefits package is great
46|amazon|cons|Communication is terrible, work/life not so great, employees treated as robots or commodities and not people. Amazon will try to pay you as little as possible and unless you get a really great boss, they aren't going to help you develop.
47|amazon|pros|#NAME?
47|amazon|cons|#NAME?
48|amazon|pros|Great part time, flexible schedule. More hours can be added as needed. Great holiday perks and food periodically.
48|amazon|cons|Too many leaders and not a lot of leading going on. At my location, some managers are there for the money only. They hide behind successful managers.
49|amazon|pros|networking, resume, promo items, paid trip to seattle
49|amazon|cons|low pay, strict culture, unfriendly colleagues
50|amazon|pros|If you search you will find opportunities to grow and learn new things.
50|amazon|cons|Like any big corporation this too has its own problems.
51|amazon|pros|The company offers fair wages and amazing great for all types of employees, and provides daily incentives to maximize productivity. It's a great first job, or an opportunity to explore an area in the field of logistics.
51|amazon|cons|The hours are long, and the jobs function can become monotonous. The repetition of work that doesn't provide any mental stimulation could be daunting to some. No phones are allowed into the warehouse, which is somewhat understandable.
52|amazon|pros|Awesome co-workers, awesome environment to work
52|amazon|cons|Long hours, poor management, not many chances for moving up or learning new things
53|amazon|pros|Consistent hours as a direct hire. 18 hours with pay guarantee. 30 days until dental and vision. 90 days until medical, which is far better than most part-time positions out there. Free beverages in the break-room, reduced costs of snacks in the vending machines. Plenty of work when the shipments are accounted for correctly. Advancement is swift if you are open to doing anything asked of you without an attitude.
53|amazon|cons|"Co-workers are a mixed bag as far as work ethic goes. A few lazy employees on the line can ruin everyone else's quota and pallet build. Few ambassadors seem capable of handling any job beyond talking to their friends while wearing a vest that proudly states ""How can I help?"". Leadership is in flux. At times it feels like things are passive-aggressive in what is asked of employees to do on behalf of the company - star??Show More"
54|amazon|pros|GREAT benefits with stock and health insurance. Pay is not outstanding but stock makes up for it.
54|amazon|cons|Management has no backbone and will not support you. Everyone fears HR
55|amazon|pros|Leadership team has excellent grip on employee
55|amazon|cons|Contractual Agreement is the reason to quit this job
56|amazon|pros|Very good quality products and usually arrives on time and when it doesn't they refund your money no questions asked
56|amazon|cons|Sometimes the product is broken or gets lost in transit and it takes longer than was expected and you can't contact sellers
57|amazon|pros|There is always room to grow cause the company is expanding
57|amazon|cons|Good workers can be let go cause they are not on managers favorite list
58|amazon|pros|I get to use some very advanced tools. Amazon is a large company so there are in-house utilities for everything. An interesting part of working at AWS is that the services are built on top of other AWS services. There are very few use cases for third-party infrastructure. If you have a problem with one of the services, you can engage with engineers on that service's team directly instead of having to go through custo??Show More
58|amazon|cons|The work is quite fast-paced, and management often has a lot of control over what you work on. The worst part about working at Amazon is having to be on-call. All engineers on a team are on an on-call rotation, which can get you paged in the middle of the night or on weekends. Even if you have no idea how to solve a problem, you have to be the point of contact on customer tickets while you have to page another engine??Show More
59|amazon|pros|Great cultural values that makes you think about how to run the company from the management perspective. One of the best companies to develop your career and to develop strong work ethic. Lot's of former ex-Amazonians have come back.
59|amazon|cons|Frugality is a pain when another tech company down the street offers free breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My friends claimed I suffered Stockholm Syndrome.
60|amazon|pros|Brilliant people around , hard working , motivational teams
60|amazon|cons|Less coding , more operational work , less challenging
61|amazon|pros|Good benefits, fairly good pay, casual environment. People bring their dogs with them to work. Nice location in downtown Seattle.
61|amazon|cons|Low retention rate. People move around a lot to different companies. I've worked there for 6 years and had 5 different managers. The commute into Seattle is a beast.
62|amazon|pros|Plenty of opportunity to learn more about Amazon and its internal tools
62|amazon|cons|Tough, competitive environment
63|amazon|pros|Good health benefits. Hourly wage is very fair for the area. Working conditions are decent. I work inside most of the time.
63|amazon|cons|Lots of management turnover and the managers are often young graduates who are not seasoned so it takes a long time for things to gel.
64|amazon|pros|Great benefits as soon as you're hired. Great management team and lots of opportunity to move up if you apply yourself. Also offers tuition assistance after one year of continuous employment and is willing to work around a school schedule.
64|amazon|cons|The actual job is very monotonous and very physical. The regular schedule is 4 consecutive 10 hour days and a fifth overtime day if needed. Pickers walk an average of 12 to 15 miles a day and at the end of a ten hour work day you go home completely drained.
65|amazon|pros|Extremely innovative company and intelligent co workers
65|amazon|cons|Training program is not sufficient to meet the companies demands and expectations
66|amazon|pros|Lots of time off, good opportunities for advancement
66|amazon|cons|They start you at one level below where they think you should be, so your first promotion, ias the job you should have had all along.
67|amazon|pros|Compensation was great and I loved being around very intelligent people. People listed to my ideas.
67|amazon|cons|Worked to death. I worked 7 days a week for over 8 months. No such thing as work/life balance.
68|amazon|pros|They give a lot of hours, simple task and a lot overtimes.
68|amazon|cons|Takes time to move up.
69|amazon|pros|Ok Money easy to get hired
69|amazon|cons|Work/life balance, Pager duty, Seattle Weather
70|amazon|pros|Flexible Schedule to work around school or another job. Decent pay considering the ease of the work.
70|amazon|cons|Physical labor, can get very tiring work
71|amazon|pros|Great brand and clients. Unique opportunity to sell a cross platform solution to some of the largest companies in the world. New products in video make the future compelling for advertising sales.
71|amazon|cons|Management could supervise a bit more, walk around to see what's really going on on the lines.
72|amazon|pros|You work hard, but it is rewarding. There is a strong network of dedicated leaders who will help you succeed if you put in the effort.
72|amazon|cons|Very aggressive sales targets. The team has experienced significant growth over the past 5 years and many partners are reaching a ceiling. The expectation is to continue a 40% YoY growth which is difficult to maintain.
73|amazon|pros|amazing company to work for
73|amazon|cons|During xmas time, work life balance can suffer.
74|amazon|pros|Great if you have no brains and like following rules.
74|amazon|cons|tough but lots of great vibes
75|amazon|pros|Lots of opportunity for interesting projects
75|amazon|cons|Very high operational work. Bureaucratic. Not good for people with brains.
76|amazon|cons|#NAME?
77|amazon|pros|Smart and driven colleagues. Had great direct manager. Hard and interesting problems to solve that really matter.
77|amazon|cons|Experience is highly dependent on getting a good direct manager that will work to get you promoted and shield you from politics
78|amazon|pros|The pay is great
78|amazon|cons|Ten hour shift are too long
79|amazon|pros|I worked in the Product Compliance as a contractor, and for the most part my job was great. My part of our team was very cohesive, we were trained well, and the managers seemed to appreciate our work. They took our concerns/suggestions for improvement into account. When I had to change my work hours due to a family emergency, they were very accommodating.
79|amazon|cons|There were definite communication issues - at one point one of the managers was very passive-aggressive in communicating a criticism she had of me, which I felt was unnecessary. There were also issues with cohesion among the team - we were divided into two groups (one of which was clearly favored) and not really given a big-picture sense of how our work affected each other (they seemed contradictory but were not, but??Show More
80|amazon|pros|There are a lot of smart people, but they think they are smarter than anyone else.
80|amazon|cons|Management is very young and don't have experience outside of Amazon.
81|amazon|pros|The company name obviously comes with perks
81|amazon|cons|A huge lack of transparency between management. Exceptionally political atmosphere where no one really wants to say the truth: Amazon is a company without a central vision.
82|amazon|pros|Teamwork, high velocity logistics, processes, and variety embrace the experiences at an Amazon Fulfillment Center
82|amazon|cons|Unreasonably low pay. Amazon needs to up its game or find themselves sharing the spotlight with Walmart and McDonalds pay reputation.
83|amazon|pros|Learn a lot of new things
83|amazon|cons|Long work time and on call pressure
84|amazon|pros|Exciting product launches and hands-on training
84|amazon|cons|Unrealistic performance goals. Senior leadership is out of touch and driven solely by the numbers.
85|amazon|pros|You get good pay and great benefits. If productivity is high, you will receive a bonus of 4% as well as your own stock from day one at Amazon. Pto, Upt, and vacation time is given on your first day.
85|amazon|cons|The managers do not appreciate the employees. They treat the employees like they are slaves. It can be a bit boring as well without any music to keep you going. It's a ten hour shift so you will want to talk to other people but they will not allow you to talk much.
86|amazon|pros|Great place to build a career nice Benifits and can move up with the hard work and some manger willing to help build your portfolios.
86|amazon|cons|Work gets redundant and boring sometimes.
87|amazon|pros|smart hard working employees, some departments manage to mitigate the giant company culture
87|amazon|cons|bloated, not as nimble as they think, senior level managers are like gods and can get away with anything without repercussions, people are just numbers - parts to be used and consumed.
88|amazon|pros|A lot of overtime was offered. Learning the job was easy, because nobody minds lending a hand. Friendly work environment.
88|amazon|cons|Managers forget that they play a leader role and like to sit behind the scenes and let the people under their pay grade handle the heavy work.
89|amazon|pros|Fast moving company. Smart people
89|amazon|cons|Depending on team, can be stressful and unreasonable
90|amazon|pros|Opportunities to move up, may help with education.
90|amazon|cons|The pay is pretty low
91|amazon|pros|If you are hired as an Amazonian you will get a pay check every 2 weeks. If you are a go-getter and can impress the managers you may move up to a Tier 3 associate(PA-Process Assistant) (there is not a tier 2 associate position in the fulfillment DC). They have restricted stocks as a benefit. Once a year they offer cash to those who want to quit Amazon. You cannot return if you take the money. People and most of manag??Show More
91|amazon|cons|Most people who are promoted to a Process Assistant (PA)(Tier 3) are pre picked before the applications are filled out and interviews are finished. The managers encourage everyone to apply and schedule an interview. But the fact is the managers already picked the people they want and the managers are using numbers to tell the associates and whoever would like to know that management is fair. Pay is low and has not in??Show More
92|amazon|pros|Learned a lot in a short period of time. They said 1 year at Amazon is like 5 years somewhere else. I felt that way during my 4 years.
92|amazon|cons|Work/life balance. I worked 10-12 hours a day and was exhausted. They don't tell you that you need to work that many hours, but if you want to get promoted then you have to put in the effort.
93|amazon|pros|I worked in the Biz Dev side of the AWS partner team for 2.5 years and loved it. The pace of innovation at AWS is mind blowing. The products and services that the team works with are market leading and the opportunity before AWS is staggering. I thoroughly enjoyed my 2.5 years there and would have happily stayed for me. I was scooped up by an AWS partner to lead an even bigger opportunity.
93|amazon|cons|AWS lives by its Leadership Principles which is mostly a good thing. If these principles resonate with you then you'll be good. If they do not then don't work there. However, there is no Principle around treating employees well. The closest is Hire & Develop the Best but that does not quite mean treating employees with respect. Within some groups at AWS it can be quite harsh. That was not my experience but I hear??Show More
94|amazon|pros|You're working with the smartest people in the industry on a lot of tough problems, so expectations are high. But there is a lot to learn if you pay attention, and the teammates are very supportive
94|amazon|cons|The intense pressure can be overwhelming, so expect to see a lot turnover. It's hard to remain motivated at times if you feel that you're falling behind.
95|amazon|pros|Easy, no customers. When you become a problem solver you have to use your head a bit which is nice. Stressful but I enjoy it
95|amazon|cons|Mandatory overtime!! :( also very very monotonous if all you do is pack
96|amazon|pros|Working in Customer Service has many areas for specialization; retail, Prime Now, Amazon Logistics, to name a few. There are multiple helpful resources to find answers to problems. There are always new projects developing. Frequent overtime opportunities. Individuals can make exceptions to policies when it's in the customers best interest.
96|amazon|cons|As a virtual employee there is little opportunity to speak with someone by voice. 99% of communication is done by email and/or chat messaging - this can be very time consuming and leads to much frustration. Entry level pay is very poor with no room for negotiation. If overtime needs are not meet voluntarily, mandatory overtime is distributed w/o notice.
97|amazon|pros|Fast paced and rewarding. People were focused on results and our team was driven to deliver on those results. Great teamwork.
97|amazon|cons|Work life balance was sometimes out of whack. Holidays could be very demanding, but everyone understood that we needed to meet customer demand.
98|amazon|pros|Met a lot of nice people; casual environment - don't have to wear suit and high heel shoes. Health care in the facility.
98|amazon|cons|very busy working as there're not enough employees in the department, possibly have to work over time. do not sponsor for H1B
99|amazon|pros|You get paid on time. You can take a lunch break. You get health insurance.
99|amazon|cons|The work environment is unpleasant. There are tons of developers crammed into large open spaces. The buildings are completely devoid of personality. There are rows of developers sitting or standing at door desks. It is a very noisy place to try and get work done. You will be constantly interrupted by people pagers going off, cell phones ringing, people talking and gathering around and dogs barking. There are lines to??Show More

102|amazon|pros|Fast paced at the ship dock, it makes time go extremely fast.
102|amazon|cons|You can get stuck with a lazy crew and it makes it more difficult for you to do your job.
103|amazon|pros|Great company to work for if you're tech oriented. The interview process was a bit thorough, but necessary, The pay was solid and I moved up within 6 months. Overall a positive employment experience.
103|amazon|cons|Management could do with providing a little more support when absolutely needed. Training materials were lacking, but not awfully so.
104|amazon|pros|Good Training program, steady work, opportunities for advancement, good benefits
104|amazon|cons|Repetitive, easy to get overlooked, high turnover rate
105|amazon|pros|Fast-paced culture where you have the opportunity to experiment and launch new ideas and innovations without bureaucracy. Generally ideas grow organically vs. are dictated from the top down which is a great opportunity for those who want to experiment with new products and features, test them, iterate and scale. Success is dependent on your ability to iterate and scale products vs. nailing it on the first launch. If???Show More
105|amazon|cons|The best strategy is to enter Amazon as a new hire MBA, build your skills with different industry leading products and technologies, and move on by year 4. For experienced hires, your ability to advance in your career is 100% dependent on the networking skills of your manager, their experience with the process, and the quality of their writing due to a highly political, subjective promotion process. There are no defi??Show More
106|amazon|pros|The experience can be different for all people. Some of the good things about working here of course are the pay and the people you have a chance to meet.
106|amazon|cons|For me it has been tedious. As a picker The job is not hard but the hours drag and by the end most people seem to be tired and wanting to go home. The managers try and make us feel energized and positive about the day but I still dread those 10 hours of walking back and forth the mods without really stopping because it might affect your rate. It is also not the best in work-life balance. The job can be draining and e??Show More

113|amazon|pros|The environment was very fast paced with emphasis on shipping products as quickly as possible while still maintaining a high quality bar.
113|amazon|cons|"At some point, decision making became too ""top-down"", which made it hard to stay engaged to products."
114|amazon|pros|For the highly motivated and ambitious there is no end to learning and role opportunities.
114|amazon|cons|Less ambitious people get marginalized.
115|amazon|pros|Oh my God, this job is the best kept secret, now mind you I had to drive a little ways to get to the job site because I live in Milwaukee, and the Job is in Kenosha, but its well worth it, the pay is great and the energy is so high, you get to wear jeans, a t shirt and tennis shoes, there's a lot of walking so you get a full work out, so if you like to stay in shape, this is the place, you get paid every Friday, my d??Show More
115|amazon|cons|the downs are I!f you don't like to drive, or live in the area, traffic could be a problem!
116|amazon|pros|Decent hours for part time. Pay is pretty good for the work. Not slave labor, nor are you treated like a slave. Very lenient on many things.
116|amazon|cons|TOO lenient on certain things. A lot of people should be let go, but aren't. Too easy for people to stand around and collect pay check. Not flexible hours.
117|amazon|pros|Amazon is an amazing place to work, learn and grow - quickly. Your peers are best in class, and you will learn more in one year than you will at other companies in 10 years. Amazon pays well through salary, bonus, and most importantly - stock.
117|amazon|cons|You'll work a lot at times, but the reward will be an amazing product that creates an opportunity or solves a problem for the customer. Best for those who desire challenge and quick growth opps.
118|amazon|pros|Customers live the service. Tips are tremendous. You are paid $18 per hour plus tips.
118|amazon|cons|Like all app based delivery jobs, too many drivers are hired. In this case, almost 200. Amazon clearly only cares about customers and not about the people on the front line so to speak who the customers actually can put a face to, which are the drivers. Working as an IC is hard enough, but after working two four day work weeks, I have not worked in twelve days and am on The schedule only once in the next seven days.???Show More
119|amazon|pros|Fast growing environment. Can learn a lot.
119|amazon|cons|Managers won't assign SDEI's interesting work.
120|amazon|pros|Amazon is a challenging and opportunistic company. I have been given the freedom to propose new ideas and implement network wide changes. Amazon has helped develop me through working in different FC's and departments in my career.
120|amazon|cons|The hours can fluctuate and shifts are approx. 12 hours long. Almost all managers work a weekend day and half of the management team works a night shift schedule. The remarkably high demands can sometimes be too much for teams to handle.
121|amazon|pros|Ownership and their leadership principles
121|amazon|cons|Slow growth in a matter of 10 years
122|amazon|pros|Good benefits, friendly coworkers, nice paycheck, feels good to have 3 consecutive days off, you are given plenty of time to use, and they do have activities for associates during the summer, and holidays.
122|amazon|cons|I can't stand the fact that it's no work-life balance. The 10 hour schedules suck, I'd rather work 8 hours shifts 5 days a week. You have to go through too much to get promoted when people you train get promoted before you. it's so much I can say but I'm going to keep at a minimum
123|amazon|pros|You get to work on a ton of stuff and use the latest AWS technologies and learn how one of the biggest software companies in the world manages its software processes
123|amazon|cons|Not a fan of being on-call, particularly as the number of services your team owns grows, since we're always writing new services and many issues only come up in production. Very fast paced work environment, and very smart coworkers, doesn't leave a lot for work-life balance
124|amazon|pros|Good Leadership, plenty of opportunities for advancement
124|amazon|cons|Plans/ideas change from day to day and can cause productivity losses
125|amazon|pros|Pretty Simple and straight foward. Friendly people.
125|amazon|cons|After a few hours you go crazy doing the same thing over and over again but after your first two weeks you'll get used to it.
126|amazon|pros|It was a pleasant work environment.
126|amazon|cons|The location was a little inconvenient.
127|amazon|pros|Competitive salary. Innovative company to work for.
127|amazon|cons|Long hours. Ambiguity. Lack of leadership
128|amazon|pros|I worked 40 hours a week until peek hit. Then my hours were up to 55 a week.
128|amazon|cons|You're feet will kill you and becoming a regular employee there is difficult
129|amazon|pros|Managers that listen, plenty of O.T.
129|amazon|cons|Too much product for size of building; Management has to scramble to accomodate
130|amazon|pros|freindly place to work, job requirements are easy to learn, fast paced environment, help from other workers is readily available
130|amazon|cons|low pay, part-time only, no opportunity for full time work, management needs to interact more with employees, management not always readily available to employees, key positions not always manned
131|amazon|pros|It looks really good on a resume. People always ask about it. Safety walks, gemba. It is great if you are young and with out a family.
131|amazon|cons|Night shift is not fun. my schedule did not work out well for my family. The workplace was very backstabbing. People always wanted to backstab. Watch out for the bus drivers.
132|amazon|pros|The pay is good for the area we are located in, able to work night shift to not have to pay for childcare.
132|amazon|cons|The long hours of standing and walking each night can be tiresome.
133|amazon|pros|Great company has a lot of business units and branches, so you might explore different teams easily.
133|amazon|cons|Company moves fast, so does the employees.
134|amazon|pros|The compensate well, working 4 and sometimes 5 days a week depending on holidays and others
134|amazon|cons|The downsides can be working on a salary base, they can throw 40 hours at you one week and 50 hours the next
135|amazon|pros|Nice coworkers
135|amazon|cons|lack of communication
136|amazon|pros|Multiple opportunities for growth
136|amazon|cons|High Turnover rate
137|amazon|pros|Working with a high number of clients all over the world increased my ability to be customer orientated and also detail orientated which was one of the most important facts in my job
137|amazon|cons|It can be really stressful dealing with upset customers.
138|amazon|pros|Extra hours available sometimes. Can wear comfortable clothing. Great people to work with. Pay is good. You get unpaid time off. You get holiday pay and perks during the Thanksgiving and Christmas time of the year.
138|amazon|cons|Training should be longer then a week. And they should stick to what they believe is good customer service for customers packages being delivered to their home or business. Not everybody should not be a blue badge.
139|amazon|pros|If you are starting out in life it is a great job. The benefits are great. I had a son last year and haven't paid for a doctor visit yet.
139|amazon|cons|Rare chance to move up, the area managers are all new hires from Virginia Tech and they come in not knowing absolutely zero. Jobs go up on the job board just long enough for the person they want to have to put in their application.(less than 24 hours)
140|amazon|pros|Awesome place work.
140|amazon|cons|No issues with the leadership principles.
141|amazon|pros|Putting in overtime, your check look nice.

142|amazon|pros|clean environment ,plenty of work if your willing to work overtime.very good benefits ,including tuition for school,bonuses(vcp),paid time off
142|amazon|cons|every high school grad with no work experience will get paid the same as a seasoned worker ,
143|amazon|pros|Decent pay considering there aren't really any prerequisites for the job. Some positions will even pay for a minimum number of hours per week, so you'll still get a decent check on slow weeks.
143|amazon|cons|Shifts could be better scheduled. Currently, the only options are in the evening, starting at either 4 PM, or 9 PM. The 4 PM shift severely limits your options for second jobs, while the 9 PM shift will gradually eat away at your sleep time. A 6 PM shift, for instance, would make the position more viable for a lot of people with other obligations during the day.
144|amazon|pros|Great learning opportunity for interns
144|amazon|cons|Work - Life balance can be improved
145|amazon|pros|Autonomy- no one is going to tell you how to do your job. You decide the best way.
145|amazon|cons|Autonomy- no one is going to tell you how to do your job. You don't get a whole lot of guidance. It's sort of trial by fire's

150|amazon|cons|I don'l like working third shift.
151|amazon|pros|The insurance benefits were great.
151|amazon|cons|This was the most poorly managed operation I have ever worked for.
152|amazon|pros|Will be exposed to new trends. You will meet very intelligent people. Many are friendly based on culture, if you click.
152|amazon|cons|Call center environment stressful and you must work hard. Breaks are monitored. No room for growth. The training is not relevant. Your pay depends on customer ratings. Cultural divisions. Management micro manages. Pushing people to take calls. You must work weekends. Low pay compared to competitors. Poor ergonomics and the benefits are very poor. HIGH TURNOVER.
153|amazon|pros|Best company to work at as a fresher

159|amazon|cons|I work nights and my manager has to be the worst for many reasons. If it werent for her i would love my job lol. Oh and the hr is very rude.
160|amazon|pros|I joined Amazon after completing my MBA from a top 5 program. In my opinion, Amazon provides the best possible environment for mid-career development.
160|amazon|cons|Before you accept the job offer make sure you are ready to put in the work required. Work/Life balance as well as project quality is heavily dependent on what team you are on so make sure to choose wisely. Also, you will likely be writing a lot of documents because there is no PowerPoint allowed so make sure you are ready to write.
161|amazon|pros|Full Time Amazon Associate Great Benefits
161|amazon|cons|Break times of 15 minutes include the travel time to refreshments/restrooms.-This place is HUGE(like-8 football fields?) so returning to work within( 15 minutes from scan to scan) is difficult to feel refreshed.
162|amazon|pros|Opportunities to work with full-time team members on many of the same tasks. Lots of respect from other employees.

168|amazon|pros|Think big. Fascinate technology. Lovely people.
168|amazon|cons|Long approval chain. Oncall. Frugal.
169|amazon|pros|Working as a PM at Amazon gives me the opportunity to dream up the future, and then actually build it. It's like having the best-funded startup ever.
169|amazon|cons|Mentally prepare yourself for rigor. There are high expectations for caliber of work. On the upside, learning + development is great because your peers are amazingly talented. On the downside, be ready to be in the middle of the pack.
170|amazon|pros|Great minds, many opportunities, challenging work.
170|amazon|cons|Odd hierarchy of mgmt that creates some tension.
171|amazon|pros|If you can dream it, share why it adds value to the Company, you can build. It's an amazing place to be part of, literally changing eCommerce daily.
171|amazon|cons|You never feel valued. Burnout, and poor management is prevalent. In an environment where folks are compensated for individual contributions, not building teams or working together, there is little recognition for Managers that care for or develop their teams. Good people are forced out of the Company daily due to the rating requirement to force out 10% of the workforce. The compensation does not reward your contribu??Show More

177|amazon|pros|Innovation and new Ideas are abundant. Expanding into new markets at a fast pace. They are one of the top cloud network providers in the industry.
177|amazon|cons|Poor leadership from middle management, no consistency between them. Work schedules are not good for families. They knee jerk react when something goes wrong in any location and implement restrictions on employee's instead of being proactive from the management and communicate to employee's. They preach taking ownership in the work place, but have it set as an impossible place for an employee to share ideas. No accou??Show More

184|amazon|pros|Great brand to have on the resume. The company is doing some very interesting projects. Opportunities to transfer across division is a great benefit.
184|amazon|cons|"The company has a ""unique culture"". Many managers and co-workers have a honeybadger mentality. This brews a lot of CYA and claiming of credit for whatever you can so that you could be safe come OLR time. There is a lot of lip service to work-life balance and collaboration. Reality is that it is just lip service."
185|amazon|pros|Good atmosphere and diverse workforce at the entry level
185|amazon|cons|Long hours, a constant emphasis on performing tasks more quickly and more efficiently. A general impression of being a cog in a giant machine that management would replace with an actual machine if possible.
186|amazon|pros|Smart people, room to grow professionally
186|amazon|cons|Fast-paced, competitive environment, teams often worked in silos
187|amazon|pros|They give everyone a chance. They don't discriminate based on age, race or gender. Lots of opportunity get overtime especially during the holidays. Lots of Unpaid time off
187|amazon|cons|Very Little Work Life Balance
188|amazon|pros|Transfer opportunities all over the country and the world, medical, dental, vision and life insurance, 401k match.
188|amazon|cons|Competitive, stressful environment. If you are a pessimist, tend to distrust people, or don't really like looking at the big picture, you will have a rough time (and you will give others a rought time). Don't apply if you're not extremely resilient.
189|amazon|pros|Good pay, flexible hours, an environment with a lot of really smart people that you will learn a lot
189|amazon|cons|On call rotation sucks. Be prepared to have no life outside of work whenever it is your turn to be on call

193|amazon|pros|It's amazing to be part of such an innovative company. We are constantly pushing boundaries of what is possible and accelerating delivery to the customer.
193|amazon|cons|While there is ample opportunity to grow with the company, internal promotions are not valued over externals, even with vast experience.

198|amazon|pros|Depending on which team your one, you could work like crazy or work a few hours a day.
198|amazon|cons|If your not in seattle, you get 0 benefits. Even when your in seattle is pretty lame on what they give back for employees.
199|amazon|pros|The reserves position is awesome because you create your own shift.
199|amazon|cons|The main issue now is that they have hired so many people that there are not too many hours available,
200|amazon|pros|You get paid enough and the work isn't difficult.
200|amazon|cons|It's difficult to work with some people and to work with some shifts that aren't yours, without playing the blaming game.

201|amazon|cons|Short breaks. At least as a part time worker.
202|amazon|pros|The only thing about working for amazon is that it looks good on resume
202|amazon|cons|HORRIBLE OLR
203|amazon|pros|You will be working with very talented and smart people. People are not afraid to throw out all of their ideas, which makes design meetings and teamwork fun and challenging.
203|amazon|cons|There is terrible work/life balance at this company. You are expected to put in long hours to stay on top of the curve. Less cool employee perks than other large tech companies. Pay is lower than other large tech companies.
204|amazon|pros|Leading edge, always something new, challenges are always right around the corner, never a dull moment. Anytime feedback is good when used the correct way.
204|amazon|cons|Work life balance, pressure to be the best creates a very competitive environment as well as tearing down those around you in an attempt to look better than your peers.

209|amazon|pros|The project asked to do is not hard. Our mentor is actually very nice.

Regarding to my team, we have enough freedom, no micromanagement, no politics. Managers are nice and smart, they help us a lot. Company is growing so fast, and you will have many opportunities. It will be very exciting working in this company, especially in??Show More
218|amazon|cons|Competitive, too many people trying to become a manager. Too high bar to get promoted.
219|amazon|pros|Amazon is one of the most fast paced work environments I've ever witnessed. Combined with the encouragement of innovation and owning your work you can choose to success or fail. If you are successful you are also well rewarded.
219|amazon|cons|"The company insists on their employees manage their work/life balance but while they encourage employees on one hand, in order to succeed in your position, you need to remove ""life"" from that equation. Also, the NY Times article was correct in many areas, especially back-stabbing. While the company doesn't promote that type of activity, they certainly don't correct employees who engage in this behavior."
220|amazon|pros|Smart people, customer-centric approach, brand recognition and prestige
220|amazon|cons|People management and employee retention is low priority
221|amazon|pros|Always innovating and striving to be better, this is a high functioning company with high demands. It will always push you to improve. Good compensation especially when the stock is appreciating.

223|amazon|pros|I work as a software development manager for Amazon at Seattle. What I like most about working at Amazon is the ability to make large scale impact on the way the world buys stuff. And I get to do that of my own accord. Autonomy, independent thinking and ownership are encouraged here better than any other place that I know of. Amazon is a great place for builders and if you enjoy building things (robots at home, softw??Show More
223|amazon|cons|The speed at which Amazon is growing resonates across the company.
224|amazon|pros|Lot of challenging problems to deal with. Mature infrastructure lets you focus on core problems rather than how o build and deploy
224|amazon|cons|Software Development Engineer bar has gone down slightly over he years as the company tries to add hundreds per month.
225|amazon|pros|Amazon is a great company. They are very good with benefits and stock bonuses.
225|amazon|cons|Not as giving as some other tech companies.
226|amazon|pros|Very challenging; expect to learn a lot in a short amount of time. Fast paced. Never a dull moment.
226|amazon|cons|Everything mentioned in the August 2015 New York Times article was spot on accurate. If someone in management doesn't like you, they harass and bully you to force you out. If you file a grievance with HR, expect nothing. It is truly a horrific place to work.
227|amazon|pros|The people I love doing at I was doing its a lot of fun
227|amazon|cons|I had to work 7 days 60 hrs a week
228|amazon|pros|Great Pay & lots of overtime available. You WILL stay busy.
228|amazon|cons|FIRST OFF, Amazon will lie to your face and make you feel like part of their company. The first hint of how awful this company is that they make you sign a waiver so that you cannot sue them on your first day! BUT, the moment you hurt yourself (which WILL happen working in the environments they expect you to work in) you will see the managements true colors. You are nothing but a number to them, and if you don't bust??Show More

231|amazon|cons|If working in Customer Service be aware that you'll get every type of customer imaginable.
232|amazon|pros|Had a great time. My internship was incredible. I worked on tough problems and learned a lot of new technologies over 3 months.
232|amazon|cons|Things tend to feel slow some days, but it's really up to you to find new challenges. The culture can be pretty stressful sometimes, but never as bad as being a college student!
233|amazon|pros|Always something new to learn.
233|amazon|cons|Hours become long during peak and when leadership staffing is not appropriate for the department.
234|amazon|pros|Lots of responsibility early on, really smart people, dynamic business setting-constantly learning and evolving as a leader.

When working here pregnant, it's a breeze until it's time leave 4 weeks before your delivery date. You get paid to sit down and chill (if your an advent reader, it's a good time to use work as your own personal library) Only good for if your desperate in getting a job.

None of the mangers know how to communicate with one another or to their employees.

236|amazon|pros|Great place, always work to be done. Good co-workers. Benefits are good compared to other places, and pay I assume is better than the surrounding businesses in the area.
236|amazon|cons|"Favoritism in management. If you are not in their ""favorite"" group it makes it kinda hard to move up and from what i've seen people get leadership roles and the position gets to their head quick."
237|amazon|pros|Amazon is a fast paced work environment with catchy company cheers and an opportunity for you to be the yell leader you can't help but get fired up about being part of the winning team...
237|amazon|cons|The training which is done among ambassadors is not uniform nor is it to the standards of the floor supervisors who will be supervising you. So be warned you will be critiqued you will be written up be sure you stay at the front of the group so you receive your instruction loud and clear! It is better to have incorrect technique than to be clueless altogether about your job.
238|amazon|pros|Benefits and incentives are amazing at Amazon.
238|amazon|cons|Strenuous Work! It like a wet shop and the management is horrible.
239|amazon|pros|I really liked it it was a easy working environment
239|amazon|cons|Didn't have any down sides
240|amazon|pros|The pay there is good and they give good hours
240|amazon|cons|To many people for them to keep track of
241|amazon|pros|Best benefits I have had working for any company. Amazon will not let you work more then 60 hr in a week they believe in a healthy home life.
241|amazon|cons|The differential between regular associate to process guides (floor supervisors) was at the time .25 cents. On your feet possibly standing in one spot for hours. The pay could be better.
242|amazon|pros|its asteady work, fun environment
242|amazon|cons|they need to pay more money
243|amazon|pros|very nice people, paid weekly.
243|amazon|cons|Weak HR most of the working time no one at office .
244|amazon|pros|Amazon is stoked with bright people, a reasonably fast pace, ever growing and expanding business, and a vibrant startup culture. Over the years, a lot of rough edges have been smoothed, and if you're on the right team (there are many great teams), it is a great career experience. The fact that Amazon obsesses over customers tends to filter out the ego maniac managers and rude people (if they can get hired by Amazon o??Show More
244|amazon|cons|"Sometimes, obsessing over customers can be a compulsive behavior that means the company is overlooking the wellbeing of the ""owners"" (Amazon-speak for employees). Lately, though, some public light has been shining on a few cases where employees weren't treated well, and that has resulted in some additional care and attention internally. I don't personally know anyone with a negative story like the ones in the press t??Show More"
245|amazon|pros|Love the summer over there, and the working environment
245|amazon|cons|rains a lot, a little bit cold in the winter
246|amazon|pros|Health Benefits are great, You cant find better.
246|amazon|cons|Unqualified managers, No people skills.
247|amazon|pros|Great benefits, some nice people, good opportunities to move up
247|amazon|cons|Long hours, some managers leave something to be desired, need a higher starting wage
248|amazon|pros|There are very skilled people who work at amazon.
248|amazon|cons|Some areas of the company are hard to work for, the Fulfillment Center is one of the worst for IT.
249|amazon|pros|You get to work on very cool things, with a lot of responsibility and ownership, in a fast paced and exciting environment. You are in the center of all things happening in technology today.
249|amazon|cons|Dont expect it to be a 40 hr a week job. Brutal demands, low work-life balance, very exhausting. Dont expect rapid promotion-even if you are a unicorn superstar. You got to pay a LOT of dues first.
250|amazon|pros|Best reason to work for amazon is definitely the benefits and insurance that they provide. It is amazing that I don't have to worry so horribly over dr bills anymore!!!
250|amazon|cons|Everyone comes to know EVERYONE!!!!
251|amazon|pros|I'm not going to lie, this is a very hard job, but that's what I love about it. I get to go super deep technically, I've worked with folks to invent cutting edge algorithms, we've routinely delivered against wildly audacious goals, and my team is brilliant. I can't imagine learning or growing more rapidly than I have here. I get to wear a lot of hats in this role: people manager, technical leader, business strategist??Show More
251|amazon|cons|"You get used to saying ""things area really crazy right now,"" and eventually realize that's just how things operate. Learning to say no and balance your own schedule is critical, because it's rare to have someone else do that for you and there's no shortage of great things to go contribute to."
252|amazon|pros|large complex systems, enterprise java, good salaries, flexible work hours
252|amazon|cons|very agile, short sprints, very small chunks of work at one time, very complex and poorly documented development environment.
253|amazon|pros|Room to move up, 3 day weekend.
253|amazon|cons|Cutthroat management tactics, hiring management from outside prior to posting positions internally.
254|amazon|pros|The no hassle benefits are great. They have plenty of shifts for everyone's preferences. It's fast paced and has a very friendly atmosphere.
254|amazon|cons|Not the best paying for industry standards. Mangers are always replaceable (and frequently are). Even if you do an awesome job, you're hamstringed by coworkers who don't care.
255|amazon|pros|They often hire from within and there seem to be a lot of opportunities to move up. They also have fantastic benefits
255|amazon|cons|Unfortunately, they have the power to change your department without say. They also choose what hours you work without your say. If you don't want to work the night shift, oh well.
256|amazon|pros|Great benefits, good coworkers, awesome company.
256|amazon|cons|Awesome job with lots of advancement.
257|amazon|pros|Laid back west coast culture
257|amazon|cons|None company stock is down
258|amazon|pros|Plenty of room for advancement at Amazon. They do like to promote from within.
258|amazon|cons|A lot of long hours year round for HR. Operations has it's peak season during the holidays, but HR's peak season is year round
259|amazon|pros|you get paid well, meet well people, and get to work as hard as you please ( for all the workaholics).
259|amazon|cons|by flexible i mean that you will have to adjust your like to your job, so you will have to be flexible. there schedules are set in stone as well as the over time.
260|amazon|pros|Good pay master
260|amazon|cons|Always in rush
261|amazon|pros|It was okay. Easy work
261|amazon|cons|Can get tiresome. Not enough people to do all the work
262|amazon|pros|Good pay, Benefits, and hours.
262|amazon|cons|Long shifts, must meet rate, breaks and lunches too short.
263|amazon|pros|Creativity encouraged due to lack of standard process.
263|amazon|cons|Mandatory seven day work schedule. Expect managers to be connected to their phone and internet. HR tolerates this behavior and has no backbone to prevent seven day work schedules as accepted norm.
264|amazon|pros|A good place to learn cloud computing and distributed systems.
264|amazon|cons|Terrible work-life-balance. No one likes on call.
265|amazon|pros|Decent high velocity place to work, not the most employee friendly company though.
265|amazon|cons|Much of the work at Amazon now is dedicated to management and bug fixing. Keep this in mind while considering an amazon position. Amazon HR tried to move me to seattle after I signed my offer for a particular team.
266|amazon|pros|Employees get a lot of autonomy to try new ideas/projects/etc. If you have a good manager and are working within a good group, it can be a great place to work.
266|amazon|cons|too many recruiters stepping over everyone's toes
267|amazon|pros|Decent, pick own hours. They do provide uniforms as well as badges and hats and you are allowed to keep any tips you have .
267|amazon|cons|No reimburse for gas or tolls, they can mess up your hours and you need to make sure that they tell you about your tips because sometimes they don't.
268|amazon|pros|Great work schedule, great coworkers,
268|amazon|cons|Mamagement looks down at employees
269|amazon|pros|It's a great opportunity for learning. You will get right in the thick of things, and will be given opportunity to do well.
269|amazon|cons|Being on a good team is very important. However, it seems moderately easy to switch teams of that option ever comes up.
270|amazon|pros|You learn a lot of new things and it's a fun place to work.
270|amazon|cons|Miscommunication of work schedule and overtime days.
271|amazon|pros|"If you find yourself in a tight-knit crew, stay there as long as you can. The biggest ""pros"" will be ones you carve out for yourself over a long period of time."
271|amazon|cons|Management is so fragmented that you'll ask four different people on your team the same question and you'll get four different answers, with no cohesion. Communication is lacking, to say the least. Absolutely no tutorial on how to execute any tasks, even ones brand new to you. Starting salary is arbitrary and there is essentially no way to manage a bump in pay unless you change jobs completely into a different area o??Show More
272|amazon|pros|"Insurance, flexibility for going to college if you've been employed for more than a year. If you can become favored among the management, you will receive the ""good"" jobs in the warehouse."
272|amazon|cons|Zero work life balance. Offers a tuition program but you are paid so lowly that you will never use it as most employees will qualify for a Pell Grant. Top out at $2 more than your starting salary after two years.
273|amazon|pros|Work with great, smart people, in a world leading environment. You will learn a lot and be challenged a lot, and you have a lot of control of your career. Some reviews state you are expected to work hard, often and smart. It is not a direct expectation, but that behavior correlates well with successful Amazonians- who would probably do that anyway.
273|amazon|cons|To some, the pros are cons.
274|amazon|pros|Great culture and people to work with. Had a good time, made great friends. Work is good, sometimes demanding but plenty of flexibility to choose your projects.
274|amazon|cons|Less perks compared to other companies. Quality of engineers went significantly down due to massive hiring and lowering the bar.
275|amazon|pros|it is a great place to work
275|amazon|cons|working for long hours sometimes
276|amazon|pros|Great people to work with. Great leaders also
276|amazon|cons|metrics to keep up with
277|amazon|pros|For the most part, you are in control of what you are doing. You don't get micromanaged a lot. At the end of the day you will be able to see if you won or lost based on how you ran the shift and what variables you had to deal with. There is not a lot of bureaucracy or red tape and things move very quickly. The day also goes by very fast. You walk out the door at the end of the day knowing exactly what you accomplishe??Show More
277|amazon|cons|The area manager job is seen by most in the FC as the most difficult job at the entire company. Work/Life balance is extremely challenging. During Peak, there is none. You will work over 60 hours per week at a minimum, sometimes up to 70. For 2 months straight the alarm clock was going off at 330am to make it in to work a 13 to 14 hour day, 5 days per week. It can get very mentally and physically exhausting. I usuall??Show More
278|amazon|pros|job was seasonal didn't get much opportunity as a permit job,Training as well but the demand was overwhelmed and they talk to you like you're a teenager,Place was clean and safe
278|amazon|cons|After the safely training l saw was a joke l thought l was back in high school,l understand about rules and safely standard but communication should be more involved than this is that and that is this ok now go to work Amazon should to better
279|amazon|pros|Ownership - I've worked at a number companies ranging from startups to companies bigger than Amazon. The level of ownership is unmatched.
279|amazon|cons|You have to be self-directed. Not everyone can do that, and those who don't struggle. We don't do a good job of helping people like that and they end up leaving.
280|amazon|pros|Autonomy, Customer Focused, Innovative Culture
280|amazon|cons|Work/Life due to extreme customer focus
281|amazon|pros|Good pay and fun people
281|amazon|cons|Long hours and stupid team leads
282|amazon|pros|Compared with many of my previous jobs which offered little to know benefits, Amazon offers a great and varied amount. Even within my short time of working with Amazon I am already seeking promotion opportunities.
282|amazon|cons|It's hard work, but still nothing to extreme.
283|amazon|pros|Has a good track record with inventory and shipping abilitys.
283|amazon|cons|Your only as good as the people you have working for you.
284|amazon|pros|paid the same as an area manager
284|amazon|cons|Treated like a glorified babysitter
285|amazon|pros|Great opportunities to work on far-reaching and impactful projects. Definitely worth working there. Lots to learn. Could be worth the challenge to your work/life balance.
285|amazon|cons|Work/life is/has been a challenge at Amazon. Some groups are better than others. Promotions can be hard to come by if you aren't willing or able to sacrifice some of your personal life in order to get it. Not for the faint at heart.
286|amazon|pros|At Amazon, you have the opportunity to work on problems that impact real customers in really big ways! We're at the forefront of multiple industries (devices, cloud computing, ecommerce, and drones to name a few). Every day, you'll be provided opportunities to make decisions that drive forward what customers care about. You'll also be surrounded by the smartest (and often funnest) people of your career. In 10+ years???Show More
286|amazon|cons|Amazon's a company that has been (an will be) in hyper growth mode. We believe in being flat and decentralized with employees expected to use high judgment (instead of complex policies). There are growing pains for any company/team growing like this. We hold our core values at the nucleus of business (which is great), but there are challenges in growing this quickly.
287|amazon|pros|Pay is very good with the shares and benefits.
287|amazon|cons|No work life balance, no structure or organization. Everyone wants to move up quickly so it creates a hostile work environment. The amount of hours you work isn't worth the money.
288|amazon|pros|Pay, Benefits, Casual Work Space
288|amazon|cons|"Back-Stabbing Work Culture, Lack of Respect and Value for Experienced Hires-Subject Experts Mostly Generalists, Rewards ""See What Sticks"" mentality"
289|amazon|pros|They offer good pay and benefits
289|amazon|cons|You have to work long hours
290|amazon|pros|Everything about the company is great, yes some people disagree with me but a job is a job you must be willing to work hard to make money. A lot of people complain about the long hours, well you knew that when you signed up. I personally didn't see any issue with the company. Pay was great, along with the benefits.
290|amazon|cons|None really, everything was great so no complaints from me.
291|amazon|pros|decent pay, but not much else to say. amazon can offer benefits, but they tend to contract a third party to avoid that for warehouse workers.
291|amazon|cons|terrible working environment in the warehouse. people were miserable and it showed. management frequently neglected the needs of its workers.
292|amazon|pros|solid amount of hours, can make good money, flexible for students/anyone in school
292|amazon|cons|exhausting work, doesn't pay enough for the long hours and quotas we have to meet, same work day in and day out gets very boring
293|amazon|pros|Pay is great if you overlook the complete lack of work/life balance; opportunity for advancement within the company - good luck promoting out of this building. Sr management will go behind your back to stop you from moving to another building
293|amazon|cons|Complete lack of accountability for some managers - drunk driving charges, inappropriate relationships with subordinates, leaving work to have drinks and then returning to work, sexist remarks in the workplace. The facility where I worked has a Senior Leadership team who have no idea how to lead. They try to motivate through fear, belittlement, and intimidation. They have no concept of how to develop or train.
294|amazon|pros|Great program with lots of visibility and cool projects
294|amazon|cons|A bit of a luck factor in terms of team/ business line and role allocation
295|amazon|pros|It is comfortable, easy to catch on and very friendly. They know that there is life outside of work and that things happen out of our hands, that may cause us to miss or be late even leave earlier. Great benifits and we're catching on to new ways of making all employes to feel comfortable and rewarded for there hard work.
295|amazon|cons|I don't think everyone realizes how much we really need each other's help from beginning to end. There's to many of the stowers that chill in isles and block isles and overfill bins. Also they don't shut them leave stolls in isles. We are having a lot of trash and items on the floor that people just walk on buy.
296|amazon|pros|Fast Paced, Friendly Management and a Nice Facility with top of the line break and computer room.
296|amazon|cons|Not a lot of hours
297|amazon|pros|Rapid growth potential, Hands-on leadership experience, clear culture and corporate values
297|amazon|cons|Crazy working hours (mostly during peak), high stress and pressure for daily performance, high turnover of associates and managers
298|amazon|pros|Benefits, internal transfers, long term growth.
298|amazon|cons|Pay is not top in industry like advertised. Lacking opportunities to move up unless you want managment
299|amazon|pros|They do have great benefits, health,vision,dental 401 k and stock options, love my schedule.
299|amazon|cons|They pay is very low. You feel like a robot. Tooany people breaks are short due to all the people and the metal detectors and badging through the doors.
300|amazon|pros|Competitive salaries; friendly people, good benefits, great space
300|amazon|cons|Corporate bureaucracy can sometimes be frustrating
301|amazon|pros|Good training place for an engineer
301|amazon|cons|Bad living place for an engineer
302|amazon|pros|Working with many different people and products. You get the opportunity to voice your opinions on subjects that matter to you and someone will actually follow up with you. Different shift patterns and different days so it makes it somewhat flexible.
302|amazon|cons|Pay is too little for all the work you have to do. Not enough vacation or paid time off considering you have to work 10 hour shifts so realistically you only will have 8 days off a year when you combine the two together. It's hard to plan out vacations
303|amazon|pros|Benefits (1st day of employment)
303|amazon|cons|Management sucks
304|amazon|pros|Amazing work culture and great career path
304|amazon|cons|Bad work life balance if you have a family
305|amazon|pros|We had personal time, we sometimes received cola cash where we can buy stuff from the store inside of amazon.
305|amazon|cons|Sometimes we are not recognized for our good work.
306|amazon|pros|Great pay and learn a lot.
306|amazon|cons|No work life balance. Hours do not make the pay worth it.
307|amazon|pros|A lot to learn for a college graduate, including but not limited to: coding, design, operation, continuous deployment, all kinds of best practices.
307|amazon|cons|Operational load can be very high for some teams. Competitive environment.
308|amazon|pros|all positive nothing bad to say
308|amazon|cons|none, cant think of negatives
309|amazon|pros|Smart people and challenging projects
309|amazon|cons|Not enough holidays & vacation days
310|amazon|pros|The work-from-home program allows so much flexibility! Great management and support teams to help you every time your working.
310|amazon|cons|Do not depend on getting full-time during off-peak season.
311|amazon|pros|It is a some what tight nit community, and they also seem to really care about you. They also care about making sure everyone is safe and comfortable. There was no tolerance for messing around with the machines.
311|amazon|cons|Not much opportunities to rise up in the company. Also the training process was difficult because of all the people they hired at the time. Seems to be run by a lot of young and inexperienced people.
312|amazon|pros|Intelligent coworkers, good company location, and good salaries.
312|amazon|cons|Not a big fan of on-call, and work life balance is not always very good.
313|amazon|pros|Much to learn, much to learn, much to learn. Colleagues and managers are very nice.
313|amazon|cons|To tired, we seldom have life because of the once mechanism but we can learn much things.
314|amazon|pros|good pay
314|amazon|cons|hr needs to get people who actually want to help
315|amazon|pros|They offer some good benefits and the pay is decent starting out,depending on your area. They provide paid maternity leave as well as continuing education benefits.
315|amazon|cons|The expectations of performance can be brutal. The retention rate is terrible. They expect you to do it one way to achieve quality but your speed will suffer for it. In the end it is all about the speed. Also expect to work 60hrs of over time during peak season. (Nov-Dec)
316|amazon|pros|You get to learn a lot in Amazon.
316|amazon|cons|None. I am learning everyday,. Nothing to complain about.
317|amazon|pros|Take Warehouse associate ideas
317|amazon|cons|Lack of respect from many Area Managers; won't get back to you when they say they will. What they promise you hardly falls through, etc.
318|amazon|pros|it was a good multinational working environment
318|amazon|cons|can be rigid in change management.
319|amazon|pros|Intellectually challenging and smart people to work with
319|amazon|cons|Sometimes the pace is too fast and demanding
320|amazon|pros|I was able to move up within 7 months and get into human resources. Getting into human resources has helped me get a better look at what a true career is.
320|amazon|cons|Some associates complain about external hiring. Many associates spend most of their time training others some of which are new management/leadership.
321|amazon|pros|I'm a recruiter for the eCommerce Platform group, and love it here. As a tech recruiter, I'm hiring software engineers and managers, PMs, support engineers and data engineers.
321|amazon|cons|I live on the eastside of Seattle, and driving in can be crazy at times. My commute coming in from Bothell can be as bad as 45 minutes - 1 hour 15 minutes, if I drive in at peak 8-830am times. I have to drive in peak times to drop the kids off, so my manager is flexible on my start time - it can still be tiring though. I'd suggest taking a bus if it matches your schedule. If you can drive in at 7am, commutes are MUCH??Show More
322|amazon|pros|good compensation and smart people
322|amazon|cons|very competitive and you will see a lot of jerks in management.
323|amazon|pros|it is a good company and comfortable
323|amazon|cons|very busy and no time to stay with family
324|amazon|pros|Great people, great management, great benefits! Many opportunities for advancement.
324|amazon|cons|Hard work but it has been described as paid exercise.
325|amazon|pros|Great benefits! Healthcare,dental,vision, 401k,monthly peformance/attendance bonuses,. Opportunities for advancement and overtime! Lots of extra perks!
325|amazon|cons|Physically demanding.Daily Rates/goals. Timeoff takes a while to accrue your first year. Long hours on your feet...shifts are ten hours plus.Management/staff have high turnover.
326|amazon|pros|Great communication with co-workers and supervisors
326|amazon|cons|The holidays will bring in some very annoyed customers
327|amazon|pros|Work is easy, Meeting new people
327|amazon|cons|Lack of communication don't say we'll get off one time then keep the belt rollin past the time and expect people to stay
328|amazon|pros|Very good pay. There was a lot of physical labor and strict working conditions, but well worth the time.
328|amazon|cons|Long, grueling hours in the summer (especially with no air conditioning), but nothing really to complain about as far as the management or how employees are treated.
329|amazon|pros|The hours and the pay has been worth it.
329|amazon|cons|Downside are lazy people like most jobs and favoritism.
330|amazon|pros|Great Pay
330|amazon|cons|Unorganized
331|amazon|pros|Good location, work atmosphere, nice colleagues and team! I learned a lot here. Good work and life balance.
331|amazon|cons|You have to consider your career path and progress yourself.
332|amazon|pros|Great company, awesome product and culture!
332|amazon|cons|Not that I can think of
333|amazon|pros|Great benefits and pay, however you are paid on a monthly basis if you can manage that schedule.
333|amazon|cons|Horrible work life balance, demand and expectation is that you work well into the evenings and you have very little time away. A vacation day has never been a true day off.
334|amazon|pros|I get to choose what hours and days I want to work. Pay is very high for an entry level job and everyone gets along.
334|amazon|cons|I can't think of any cons at the moment, I've been extremely happy working at the amazon fulfillment center.
335|amazon|pros|good pay, works with my school schedule, lots of opportunities to grow within the company
335|amazon|cons|work load can be taxing at times dues to required finishing times in order to make numbers.
336|amazon|pros|I like this job because I'm scheduled to work overnight. I've been in the cs field for a long time and this is cs too but you don't have to talk to anyone. I work on the receiving line so I just scan boxes all night.
336|amazon|cons|I don't like having to work all weekend but it is temporary. You do have to work fast to meet productivity. In my department we are expected to scan 160 pieces per hour and sort 200 pieces per hour. Sometimes it's easy but if you get a lot of heavy things to sort it can be difficult.
337|amazon|pros|Awesome hours and had to cover multiple locations. Nice perks, but could always be better.
337|amazon|cons|Perks could have been better for a largely based sales company.
338|amazon|pros|competitive pay. amazon discount. no micro management
338|amazon|cons|temps in and out. peak season...too many people
339|amazon|pros|Competitive compensation, work with smart people, bring dogs to work, drink at work (you'll need it)

342|amazon|cons|low EQ employees, lots of hierarchy
343|amazon|pros|Unrated tasks
343|amazon|cons|task become simple over time
344|amazon|pros|I liked my bosses and people I worked with. Hourly pay was decent for not needing any experience. It filled a need for a few months and wasn't a big deal when I quit,
344|amazon|cons|I was a seasonal employee which they do to a lot of people so they don't have to pay benefits.
345|amazon|pros|Great place to work!
345|amazon|cons|Role can be confusing at first
346|amazon|pros|You need to be very self driven. There is very little hand holding here. A lot of respect for innovative thinkers who drive projects.
346|amazon|cons|There is not much respect for good, task oriented workers. If you do as you are told and not much else you will burn out here quickly. You must also know when to drop things on the floor because the amount of work will always be more than your time.
347|amazon|pros|Plenty of perks. Very flexible with scheduling. No one on one interviews.
347|amazon|cons|Not enough hours in the fulfillment centers.
348|amazon|pros|Good Culture. Used to have lot of parties for interns.
348|amazon|cons|I don't think I had any bad experience while working as an intern. Interns were treated as kings.!
349|amazon|pros|Really smart people, a lot of opportunity for growth, always encouraged to be innovative, think big, and create something new. Competitive salary and benefits with other major tech companies. 100% self motivating work environment. No dress code and 4 legged friends are welcome.
349|amazon|cons|You have to be self motivated. NO ONE will hold your hand and tell you that you're doing a great job. If you need constant affirmations from management, this company isn't for you
350|amazon|pros|It has good salary. And the environment is good.
350|amazon|cons|Too busy, a lot of projects.
351|amazon|pros|Getting to solve technical problems at scales that do not exist elsewhere. Working with some of the smartest people on the planet
351|amazon|cons|Amazon can be a bruising environment for those that are not used to having their ideas challenged. This criticality is not always a bad thing but this idea of questioning everything often causes more problems than it solves.
352|amazon|pros|nice check, nice PTO . its ok
352|amazon|cons|get treated like a nobody, its all who you know in order to move up, employees dont matter
353|amazon|pros|Great place to work and to develop.
353|amazon|cons|Nothing to say in here.
354|amazon|pros|The people are intelligent and down to earth, you get a lot of exposure, and are able to make decisions that affect millions of customers
354|amazon|cons|Your work/life balance really depends on what team you're on--some teams work 50-60 hours per week while others work upwards of 80 hours.
355|amazon|pros|Focused on results.
355|amazon|cons|Seems hard to get rid of bad people.
356|amazon|pros|Flexible work hours, wide access to resources, fast moving, intelligent coworkers, casual dress attire, very efficient, not may bureaucratic obstacles
356|amazon|cons|Team vary greatly. Many people are type A, bold and unapologetic, and it is common to see that people are eager to point out others mistakes in order to make themselves look good. A little bit cut-throat. Many employees lack work life balance
357|amazon|pros|Technology, company structure, scale. SDE teams are encouraged to operate like startups while leveraging the power of a robust and active internal technology stack
357|amazon|cons|Located in Detroit, average lifespan for SDE's is very short. 2 years average
358|amazon|pros|Challenging environment full of smart people
358|amazon|cons|Work life balance is also challenging, this is part of working in a very fast paced environment.
359|amazon|pros|Nice pay, knowledgeable staff, I had a great manager.
359|amazon|cons|Busy day, difficult to maintain work-life balance.
360|amazon|pros|The money is good and the benefits not bad.
360|amazon|cons|In general it is a discouraging, sad place to work. Micromanagement seems to be the secret leadership principle.
361|amazon|pros|Excellent pay, and health benefits. Depending on your organization, the work culture could be stress free. Peers are technically excellent and the hiring committee makes sure of that.
361|amazon|cons|Pager duty, too much operational work, too much oncall tasks. The annual review process makes for a competitive environment in which you will be pitted against your peers in your own team.
362|amazon|pros|Working with smart people who were always working to improve things. I also enjoyed being part of a winning team.
362|amazon|cons|My family life suffered. Although I had a lot of success, I failed to manage my personal life and what I did each day wasn't scalable long term
363|amazon|pros|As a Tier 3 in a fulfillment center, it's been a rewarding experience. You have a lot of tools to help you succeed, if you know how to look for it. There are mentor programs, 'leadership' classes, the career choice program, etc. I've always been fortunate in my management!
363|amazon|cons|It's a stressful environment, projects are constantly being assigned, expectation will be raised constantly, etc.
364|amazon|pros|Lots of opportunities to learn and move around. Some really awesome people, the downside of which is, they don't stay at Amazon.
364|amazon|cons|"The extremely high turnover makes it really hard to just DO YOUR JOB, let alone do it extraordinarily well. The lack of depth and breadth of knowledge because most people are new means you get a lot of wrong information/wrong answers, and spend an inordinate amount of time just chasing down basic information to do your job. Lots of time wasted spinning your wheels here, since there is little to no ""institutional memo??Show More"
365|amazon|pros|I love working for a company customers love. Every time someone learns I work for Amazon I hear a story about why they love Prime or their Kindle. Many people also have great stories about customer service going above and beyond. This is vastly different from other companies I've worked at where the first priority was profit and cool tech regardless of what customers wanted.
365|amazon|cons|Schedules can be grueling around big releases and winter holidays due to the nature of the retail business.
366|amazon|pros|It's impressive how much responsibility and opportunity you're given compared to comparable career levels at other companies. That are lots of big projects. I've had the opportunity to launch new devices and entirely new online retail shopping experiences internationally. The energy rivals any start-up I've been in during my career - but we never have to worry about making payroll!
366|amazon|cons|If you live on the outskirts of the East Side, the commute into Seattle can get a bit old at times. But there's enough flexibility you can work around the core of rush hour traffic.
367|amazon|pros|* a place where builders build. I've designed and built some enormous systems, doing difficult tasks.
367|amazon|cons|*Downtown Seattle traffic is getting difficult and the public transportation has gotten worse over the years. I spend 9 enjoyable years taking the bus, but now must drive myself.
368|amazon|pros|Innovation, continued focus on positively impacting customers, autonomy (and accountability) to make critical decisions, work with and learn from incredibly smart people.
368|amazon|cons|The work culture is intense and some folks might feel undue pressure to match some of the more effective people around you. I am no exception to this rule, but as I understood the culture better, I have come to realize that I don't have to race with my peers to succeed here. In many teams, the relentless pace of innovation might result in more operational burden, but most teams take this very seriously and have highl??Show More
369|amazon|pros|fun work most of the time
369|amazon|cons|lots of associates there all the time
370|amazon|pros|Most managers are nice and helpful,
370|amazon|cons|HR employees are rarely on site, for assistance,
371|amazon|pros|Good medical benefits, VCP (a form of profit sharing), stock in the company (restricted until you have 2 years as an amazon employee), and various raffles and gift card giveaways for tier 1 employees, vacation time, personal time (paid and unpaid) that is accrued over time
371|amazon|cons|Extremely demanding job physically and mentally, Under constant pressure to meet production rates and quality standards, Hidden undercurrent of politics and favoritism that can be found within most large corporations
372|amazon|pros|Motivating, intelligent, team, ahead, the best
372|amazon|cons|challenging hard work that takes time
373|amazon|pros|Have several family members working here. Good base pay, starting hours are good. A half hour lunch. Really good coworkers. Nice management.
373|amazon|cons|After a while, it gets tedious and redundant. Feels like it no longer matters.
374|amazon|pros|Great company to continue your education
374|amazon|cons|High school playground with associates
375|amazon|pros|Flexible Hours - I can start my day when ever I want.
375|amazon|cons|Commuting into Seattle isn't great and it can be difficult to find parking that is reasonably affordable.
376|amazon|pros|Challenging work environment, huge opportunity for growth, competitive pay, and great benefits. If you like seeing results and being recognized as the worldwide leader in operations, supply chain mgmt, and working for a Fortune 50 company like Amazon, then this is the perfect opportunity for you.
376|amazon|cons|Because working for Amazon Operations is a very results driven and rapidly changing career, the stressful work environment might not be for everyone. Each fulfillment center however has strong leadership in place and encourages obtaining help from peers if struggling with projects or change.
377|amazon|pros|great pay at starting at 13.25 an hour. very flexible hours
377|amazon|cons|long repetitive work in hard conditions
378|amazon|pros|Big company, famous company, can learn lots of things to improve myself
378|amazon|cons|Manager level is tough and rude, no management skills at all. not good for life and work balance. get phone call at 3:00am of midnight, lower pay, cheap company
379|amazon|pros|The opportunity for advancement is abundant here at Amazon
379|amazon|cons|Look forward to long hours during Peak season
380|amazon|pros|When you venture into a job with Amazon, you are likely not going to be prepared for what you experience. Amazon is a place where you will have very challenging work for a very good cause, customer experience. I have a career of working in the customer service business and I've learned more and achieved more in my time with Amazon than with any other organization.
380|amazon|cons|No company is perfect at all things and there are certainly things Amazon can do better. First is correcting the perception that there is no work/life balance. i have been in roles in Amazon where there was very little balance and I've been in roles where there is a good balance. What I've come to learn, is it is generally on me to draw those lines and stick to them. The company does need to do more to help employees??Show More
381|amazon|pros|Amazon provides a dynamic and agile work environment in a growing industry. Opportunities abound to move around within the company.
381|amazon|cons|Working for Amazon is incredibly demanding. The company is highly data driven and every action must be backed with copious amounts of hard data. Do not expect decent work/life balance if working in operations.
382|amazon|pros|This is a company that is great to work for. They are constantly challenging you to perform and finding different ways to stay motivated. They treat every day as a new challenge.
382|amazon|cons|Pushing people to their limits on speed for numbers has its downside. People get fatigued and frustrated when pushed in this fashion.
383|amazon|pros|Worked here for 9+ years. In my past 9 years, I worked on various large scale systems like building a cloud based call center solution, warehouse automation and optimization and even solving travelling salesman problem at logistics. If you are really into computer science and building system that scales, Amazon has a lot of opportunities
383|amazon|cons|Work life balance varies by organization. In most of the orgs I was in, work life balance was okay, not as bad as others claim to be.
384|amazon|pros|Very easy work to do
384|amazon|cons|Long hours if you work overnight
385|amazon|pros|Amazon provides divers unique opportunities for personal and career growth, networking capabilities, travel, and learning & development.
385|amazon|cons|Politics can get in the way of accomplishment in certain functions, and the silo effect can lead to competition for resources and priority.
386|amazon|pros|Working in a climate controlled environment, casual dress code. Large break room with TVs and vending machines. Lots of open communication between management and regular employees daily
386|amazon|cons|Flex hours schedules allows for 3-5 hr shifts depending on volume. Be prepared to buy comfortable walking shoes.
387|amazon|pros|The pros at Amazon are that you will never find yourself bored and wondering what you could be doing. The work is always plentiful and provides challenges to work through.
387|amazon|cons|Some metrics you get rated on are outside of your control. You still need to find solutions to those uncontrolled outcomes by creating new solutions to increase your culture of safety.
388|amazon|pros|I really enjoyed working at due to the fact that I enjoy working more then 8 hours, I liked my job and the employees, there are two shifts: morning and evening, so you can pick according to your flexibility!
388|amazon|cons|Management needs to pay attention all the workers equally, co-workers were friendly but managers sometimes get rude.
389|amazon|pros|Awesome place that is doing some incredible things. I love working here. Work hard have fun and make history is really what they ask of you.
389|amazon|cons|None. Work is work. Every job is going to ask you to work hard and I love that this is a value here. It's important.
390|amazon|pros|Everyone is working on things that matter to customers. Amazon thinks about the long term; when things go wrong or are unsuccessful, we mine the experience for lessons to be learned and move forward. Amazon recognizes that failure is inevitable; it rewards individuals that learn quickly and iterate from failure.
390|amazon|cons|There are always more interesting things to do than hours in the day, and Amazon will take as much time as you give. You have to be willing to set and enforce your own limits to maintain work/life balance. That means saying 'no' to things that seem super interesting.
391|amazon|pros|Great team, great pay, great hours (always 40 or less), and nice to be around so many smart people.
391|amazon|cons|Not every team is equal, some have it really rough, but a lot don't.
392|amazon|pros|Very results driven culture where you see see your impact
392|amazon|cons|fast paced environment; the pressure to perform, and always perform is across the company hierarchy;
393|amazon|pros|cohesiveness of the teams, good managers and strong work ethics of all Facilities Techs
393|amazon|cons|Operations team creates a lot of issues that could be avoided, creates work for us that is time wasted, should be spent improving and developing equipment and processes to make the facilities more profitable.
394|amazon|pros|The work hours is very cool
394|amazon|cons|Some times e have to use extra time to work
395|amazon|pros|From my experience at other large tech companies, I'd say that Amazon stands out as being challenging. At other tech companies, you may have more vacation days. At other tech companies, you may have more perks. What you are unlikely to have at another tech company is a role which allows you to stretch yourself to the limits.
395|amazon|cons|"I would say the most clear downside is that Amazon is brutal to someone who can't manage their own time. That's the most common situation I've seen where someone didn't do well at Amazon. Saying ""no"", prioritizing and dropping things on the floor when needed is a crucial skill. As I mentioned in my pro section, we often have 1 person doing the job a whole team really should be doing. So you're going to have to figure??Show More"
396|amazon|pros|they truly care about their employees.
396|amazon|cons|Not many full time positions
397|amazon|pros|Work from home, benefits, PTO, Sick Time.
397|amazon|cons|Metrics are not fair. Could do better.
398|amazon|pros|Amazon offers an opportunity to excel in an ever-changing, fast paced environment. Benefits including full medical, dental, vision as well as tuition assistance (95% paid upfront). My experience at Amazon has been noting short of fantastic. I have been able to excel and advance in one of the most competitive environments I have ever known.
398|amazon|cons|If your idea of work-life balance is heavy on the life and light on the work, you probably won't enjoy this atmosphere. 60+ hour work weeks are pretty much the norm form October to January due to high customer demand. There is a huge disparity between salaries paid to exempt vs non-exempt employees.
399|amazon|pros|Exciting place to work
399|amazon|cons|Long Hours
400|amazon|pros|Rewarding work environment that pushes you to learn and grow quickly.
400|amazon|cons|Sink or swim mentality that doesn't value people development as much as it should.
401|amazon|pros|Time off is abundant. 48 hours Paid time, 8 days Unpaid time, Vac 1st yr - 1 week, 2nd yr - 2wks
401|amazon|cons|You run out of time, you run out of a job. But this seems fair and leaves you in charge of your time and life
402|amazon|pros|I worked at the Local fulfillment center in Tampa as a seasonal hire. You'll be working 5x11 shifts so be prepared for that. Use your sick days wisely. It must be said that all of the managers i met were very nice and understanding.
402|amazon|cons|During the orientations we were told their would be many opportunities for promotion from seasonal to full-time employment. Nobody on my floor managed to pull that off.
403|amazon|pros|Great company, good technology exposure, good ownership model and usually the teammates are smart and nice and projects are impactful.
403|amazon|cons|Be careful on team selection, some teams have ridiculous support responsibility where as a developer you cannot really build much
404|amazon|pros|fast growing company with a lot of potential
404|amazon|cons|there is much ambiguity among the team
405|amazon|pros|I've been with Amazon for over 8 years, working as an Sr. Software Development Engineer currently on-track to a likely Principal Engineer promotion within a few years.
405|amazon|cons|The promotion process is, at best, convoluted. As I mentioned above, I'm having discussions all the way up to people at the VP level concerning Principal promotion requirements, and it's basically a one to two year process to get all of the ducks in a row, so to speak. On top of that, the formal titles and levels don't necessarily match the rest of the industry: what an SDEIII (aka Senior Software Development Enginee??Show More
406|amazon|pros|Great benefits, competitive pay, manage your own time off, earn rewards, overtime, clean bathrooms and cafeterias, college reimbursement, security, employee stock options, 4 day work shifts
406|amazon|cons|10 hour shifts on your feet, half hour lunch
407|amazon|pros|I love the intensity, dedication, and energy we all had to put in to make sure every family got what they needed. It has been the most rewarding job I have ever had. It made me feel good when we got done with shipping out all of our orders and breaking records.
407|amazon|cons|There isn't anything I didn't like about my job, the people around me, or the facility. It was an all around great expirence.
408|amazon|pros|The Amazon environment is ever changing and you'll have a lot of opportunity to own many aspects of the business.
408|amazon|cons|To thrive you have to be comfortable with uncertainty. Teams are constantly rotating and your job function will constantly evolve.
409|amazon|pros|Good rotation program after mba school. Some group may be demanding but you have lots to learn and improve.
409|amazon|cons|Demanding environment, and fast changing. Benefits not very well. Not many holiday
410|amazon|pros|They hire smart, and they pay for hard work
410|amazon|cons|Say yes to every task and you'll burn out quick.
411|amazon|pros|opportunity ,insight, data, training, guidance
411|amazon|cons|parking, perception, rate, labor hours
412|amazon|pros|A is a Quick company; I could learn a lot; there are quite a lot charming products.
412|amazon|cons|Sometimes the work-life balance is not that good; the company is too huge.
413|amazon|pros|Most amazing and innovative company on the planet
413|amazon|cons|High expectations and intense workload
414|amazon|pros|Easy to work with schedule, Friendly Managers, Relatively Stress Free Work Load, Offer A Great Deal Of Perks To Employees During Thee Holiday Season.
414|amazon|cons|Would Love It If they Offered More Hours To Employees That Were Willing And Able To Work Them, Other Than That No Complaints.
415|amazon|pros|learned a lot and nice work experience
415|amazon|cons|Did not feel anything about downsides.
416|amazon|pros|Great benefits. Amazing attendance policy and lots of paid time off and vacation time available as soon as you start.
416|amazon|cons|I work at one of their fulfillment centers, and it is very hard work. That is, if you are a hard worker. It seems like the lazy people get to stick to the easier jobs. However, I'm sure their jobs are less secure.
417|amazon|pros|lost 50 lbs in 3 months
417|amazon|cons|repediative work , 10 hour days
418|amazon|pros|Even though it was work-at-home job, you will have a lot of time interacting with leadership team (meetings, chats, etc,.) It was fun experience.
418|amazon|cons|salaries (Minimum wage), benefits (10% off, capped to $100 per calendar year) as part time employee. expect to get non-stop calls. it's pretty slow during holidays.
419|amazon|pros|People always have helpful advice for you. You will really learn a lot there.
419|amazon|cons|The location for the company is in downtown which brings inconvenience.
420|amazon|pros|Good work environment, great safety procedures, good pay and benefits
420|amazon|cons|Wish breaks were a little longer being that it takes 5 minutes to get out the door because the warehouse is large
421|amazon|pros|Working as a team being around people having fingering paid every week

423|amazon|pros|Fair place, reasonable hours, chances for professional growth
423|amazon|cons|There is a definite ceiling to how far you can go, the raises tier needs work, peak season is always a rough time for your personal life
424|amazon|pros|Good team members to work with. I love the offices and we are working on great projects that will build up my CV. RSUs are great as well and make up for the bonus.
424|amazon|cons|long hours, no bonuses paid, i have a long commute. I am traveling a lot too from Seattle to the bay.
425|amazon|pros|Very decent pay for young workers
425|amazon|cons|Disciplinary and time system sucks
426|amazon|pros|Working for AWS has been the highlight of my career thus far. I've spent more than 4 years at the company - with a short break in the middle. So many learning opportunities in this company and opportunities to make a difference at all levels. Despite being a larger company there is plenty of chance to be impactful whether you're in the field, in engineering, or sales and marketing roles. The rate of change in the bus??Show More
426|amazon|cons|Delivering and insisting on the highest standards is not for everyone. If you're working on product launches and it becomes crunch time then you are likely to be working harder than a regular 9-5 job. With that said, though, I've got many friends who manage a good work life balance. Some roles make that easier than others so it's worth choosing wisely. Amazon isn't a company that coddles its employees though...so if???Show More

432|amazon|pros|Many growth opportunities, work life balance, many fun activities and other benefits for employees, great career growth.
432|amazon|cons|Work load is very high in some peak seasons ,work pressure is very high
433|amazon|pros|It really depends on which team/management you are working with, and since Amazon is very big, some employees can have a very different experience than I have.
433|amazon|cons|On-call. Not every team has this, but some teams do. For some teams, on-call is a breeze, and for others it is a nightmare. But this should come naturally to teams who are responsible for multi-million dollar code directly impacts customer experience. Although at first it may seem pretty daunting, once you get in the rhythm it's really not that bad. Plus most managers/teams are pretty understanding and you can come i??Show More
434|amazon|pros|Good pay, great benefits, stock options, 401k
434|amazon|cons|Some management can be very horrible to work for. A lot of management is young kids straight out of college and don't know anything about discipline, how to control a numerous about of people. Management doesn't respect the hourly warehouse employees much. No real chance of moving up of being promoted. Job could be hard on the body physically and mentally.
435|amazon|pros|great place to work. good benefits.
435|amazon|cons|long hours and management is not that good
436|amazon|pros|4 day work week. Good pay and benefits. Energetic atmosphere. Ability to see and familiarize yourself with many many products
436|amazon|cons|Not very employee friendly. They will push you to hit rates that are a bit extreme. Mandatory overtime that may not be announced until the day before. Long shifts. You may get a three day weekend but the first day is catching up on sleep.
437|amazon|pros|Benefits are really good to.
437|amazon|cons|Management and long hours on your feet
438|amazon|pros|The pay is pretty decent
438|amazon|cons|They don't value their workers
439|amazon|pros|Cool coworkers and atmosphere and a lot of small things that make you smile
439|amazon|cons|Understanding that its seasonal part-time job - nothing negative
440|amazon|pros|This is a work from home position. Fast paced and high volume call activity. There is ample opportunity for overtime.
440|amazon|cons|The training doesn't translate to actual work activities. The hiring process was disorganized. The feedback on performance is lacking.
441|amazon|pros|I love the earning potential and the perks are amazing! Set schedule, tons of overtime, amazing benifits... 401k, medical, dental, vision, meds effective the day of orientation... tuition assistance after only 1 year of full time employment, Paid Time Off, Unpaid Time Off, and Vacation Time... cumultive from day one!

447|amazon|pros|Good working environment, Good company culture, Good salary and bonus...Overall, right choice to work here!
447|amazon|cons|Still need time find cons.
448|amazon|pros|Fast paced -
448|amazon|cons|Pay is low, no benefits,
449|amazon|pros|This organization never sits still. We are always consistently trying to disrupt the status quo if not creating a whole new vertical. It's amazing to see how nimble an organization of this size can be. Finally, the people you work with are just amazing - extremely intelligent, hardworking and understand that boundaries only exist in the mind.
449|amazon|cons|Because the company is so large, there is a high possibility that someone has already worked on your project so the task of merely digging up prior work and data is a time sink and often frustrating. This means often delivering slower and that could be frustrating for people like me who need to deliver fast.
450|amazon|pros|Amazon is the most fun and professional company I have worked for in over 20 years. The onsite district manager and area managers are extremely approachable, proactive, and professional. Everyone from the bottom up starts the shift with brief company updates, employee success stories, and group warm-up exercises in addition to other safety promoting tips. The pay is more than fair for a part-time position and the env??Show More
450|amazon|cons|There are no cons to working at Amazon.
451|amazon|pros|Your development expertise will grow immensely. You are surrounded by some of the smartest engineers in the world, so you learn a lot
451|amazon|cons|VERY fast paced, sink or swim, but if you can swim you'll go far. Oncall is required on pretty much every team
452|amazon|pros|I enjoyed working at Amazon, for a few reasons: Great culture. People are friendly. Good work hours. Compensation meets market value.
452|amazon|cons|Although it was overall a positive experience, upward mobility was difficult.
453|amazon|pros|Will hire anyone and you can walk around all day
453|amazon|cons|Too many people don't know what you do
454|amazon|pros|Flexible hours, good for job for a self starter.
454|amazon|cons|Company can shut down your publishers account for any reason at all for arbitrary reasons.
455|amazon|pros|Very positive experience- excellent management team and team building attitude
455|amazon|cons|The only negative that I would say for AWS is the salary growth for longer term employees.
456|amazon|pros|Very easy warehouse job. Amazon really emphasis safety of their employees. My direct leaders are easy to get along with and are not afraid to jump in and help when you're busy.
456|amazon|cons|No differential in pay if you work in different departments.
457|amazon|pros|The company is innovative and fast paste. I am glad that I chose Amazon as my first full time job. Easy to move around the company and change roles.
457|amazon|cons|Amazon is pretty frugal and it doesn't give you perks. Depending on the team you could work long hours.
458|amazon|pros|Hours pay are pretty good
458|amazon|cons|Layoff rate is very high after December
459|amazon|pros|Demanding, Rewarding, Challenging are just a few of the positives derived from employment at Amazon.

460|amazon|pros|Not too much to say
460|amazon|cons|On call
461|amazon|pros|"If you develop any intellectual property, at all, I'd advise working here, completely and wholeheartedly, because they seem to be so interested in it, they may do just about anything to ""help"" you out with it."
461|amazon|cons|"The intellectual property that I develop, seems to be mirrored in its likeness and in its nearly identical timing of those same intellectual property developments, as it relates to the variety of similarly associated/named/etc. products that are located in the bins that I ""pull"" product from to obtain customer orders. Maybe it's just a funny coincidence or potentially, a friendly reminder of the tasks I'm meant to do??Show More"
462|amazon|pros|Every department is easy and not hard to catch on to
462|amazon|cons|It's mentally and physically draining , you spend a lot of time alone and you're required to work extremely hard
463|amazon|pros|Amazon is great company to work for as Control System Specialist.
463|amazon|cons|Amazon being an E-Commerce is not very user friendly. It was very difficult to obtain information and technical help from other co-workers worldwide.
464|amazon|pros|Good people, monthly bonus, lots of people to talk to, overtime opportunities, chance for advancement, prizes for attendance
464|amazon|cons|Very repetitive work, can feel like just a number, high expected rates, body hurts after work, mandatory overtime is required
465|amazon|pros|Committed customer centricity, bright people
465|amazon|cons|Can be too process driven
466|amazon|pros|You'll never learn as much anywhere else, or work as hard or as fast. The brand recognition makes you a target for headhunters.
466|amazon|cons|A bad manager can kill your chances, and the atmosphere can be brutal - particularly the anonymous feedback system.
467|amazon|pros|Consistent hours, decent time off, immediate benefits for blue badges.
467|amazon|cons|Upper management doesn't listen to people on the floor, very disorganized, doesn't value high performance employees.
468|amazon|pros|Great benefits. Safe work environment.
468|amazon|cons|Bad schedules. Young managers with no management experience.
469|amazon|pros|Working from home was an ease, pay was good, management was top notch.

475|amazon|pros|Its a fun, inobative enviroment
475|amazon|cons|Amazon has daunting work hours
476|amazon|pros|highly collaborated,
476|amazon|cons|depends on team. My team is not a mature team so you kinda lost sometimes. But some of my friends really have a better experience, in their teams.
477|amazon|pros|Opportunity to grow within the company
477|amazon|cons|Long hours standing on feet constantly
478|amazon|pros|I just got a job with Amazon and am very excited to start. Great company with a big signing bonus!

479|amazon|pros|Great place to work for extra money and good part time job
479|amazon|cons|Too many bosses in one place
480|amazon|pros|Great company to say you work of and it's a huge learning opportunity. Generally feel a sense of accomplishment as an owner of a team of people.Your peers will be extremely smart and motivated. The standards here are very high and you will be challenged every day. In this job I am never bored, the pace is very fast.You get to work with some of the smartest, most capable people, on the most interesting problems. Lots???Show More
480|amazon|cons|Amazon success depends heavily on upper management, it all depends on who your senior managers are. I came from another building and went to TPA2 who has horrible senior leadership. Promotions are not based on who has the best shift or process improvement, but instead the process is subjective and is a popularity contest. TPA2 has a lot of senior managers who are friends with their direct reports who soon get promoti??Show More
481|amazon|pros|Company was very involved with making the work environment a better place.
481|amazon|cons|Department heads need more training.
482|amazon|pros|Good place to work, but long hours
482|amazon|cons|Long hours, not a lot of appreciation
483|amazon|pros|Great benefits, solid pay, very casual atmosphere and fairly supportive local (DFW) staff.
483|amazon|cons|Lack of opportunities out of one division or another.
484|amazon|pros|Wonderful employees & great bonuses. If you go through integrity staffing which is a great hiring company! I personally loved the job & staff. Quit because I couldn't do third with my little one at home.
484|amazon|cons|Standing for ten hours a day is hard on your body. I was on night shift which was extra hard. If I had lived in Lexington I would have stayed just tried to switch shifts.
485|amazon|pros|Great company that everyone should endeavor to work with. It's one big family that works toward the ultimate goal-the customer
485|amazon|cons|There is nothing negative I can say bout this company. It's all that one hopes for in a company and everyone owns part of it
486|amazon|pros|Amazon growing company have opportunity to excel with great pay and benefits.
486|amazon|cons|Peak season could be rough sometimes and dealing with certain associates might be hard.

487|amazon|cons|Your feet hurt when you first start but you'll get used to it after a while!
488|amazon|pros|- Learn a lot, haven't been bored yet.
488|amazon|cons|Stress cesspit. I have been stressed ever since I have joined over a year ago with 2 weeks not being extremely stressed during Holidays, and then back to constantly being stressed out. There is a constant push, you have to juggle multiple tasks at once while expected to have quality which translates to ton of hours. I think I worked more weekends than I had free weekends, get ready to work tons of hours.
489|amazon|pros|Packing: If you love to just zone out and do your job it's perfect. All you do is stand in one spot looking at a monitor and boxes and items for 10 - 12 hours a day 4 - 6 days a week.
489|amazon|cons|Packing: It's incredibly monotonous and soul draining
490|amazon|pros|Extra money during Christmas time .Overtime if you need it

492|amazon|cons|Not anything I can think about.
493|amazon|pros|Good hours, nice pay and lots of people to meet. Great benefits and awesome staff.
493|amazon|cons|no flexibility, standing for long periods of time. short breaks, and they expect you to be back 3 minutes early.
494|amazon|pros|great entry level job for pay and benefits. Learning dept does a good job teaching and coaching
494|amazon|cons|Management is poorly selected below operations tier 5 AKA any one with leadership on there vest this includes HR.
495|amazon|pros|Good pay, good benefits. You get to work with some of the smartest, most capable people, on the most interesting problems. There are almost unlimited opportunities within the company.
495|amazon|cons|Demands are high, and the decentralized nature of the company mean that culture can vary from team to team.
496|amazon|pros|Compensation is great. Learning on and designing ginormous micro-service based architectures. It's a great chance to learn how to design huge, scalable, fault-tolerant systems.
496|amazon|cons|The culture kind of sucks. Everyone's got cash, just not enough fun to go around... crushing bureaucracy, major hierarchy, ask for permission to pick your own nose, etc., etc.
497|amazon|pros|Seattle downtown
497|amazon|cons|Politics influence your rating and promotion
501|google|pros|* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).
501|google|cons|* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).
502|google|pros|1) Food, food, food. 15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone. Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.
502|google|cons|"1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires t… Show More"
503|google|pros|You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.
503|google|cons|I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.
504|google|pros|- You drive yourself here. If you want to grow, you have to seek out opportunities and prove that your worth. This keeps you motivated.
504|google|cons|- Google is a big company. So there are going to be winners and losers when it comes to career growth. Due to the high hiring bar, most people who don't win are smart people as well and their experience sours. This place is optimized to avoid false positives in every step and false negatives are inevitable. At least when you get promoted, you can feel good that you have truly done something.
505|google|pros|Teamwork, always someone who can help, competitive, fun environment, free food, intelligent colleagues everywhere
505|google|cons|not family-friendly now that I have kids - I don't wan to spend time playing ping pong and taking advantage of free fun events. I want to get home with my kids.
506|google|pros|Great culture, smart, motivated employees
506|google|cons|Can be cloistered, ivory tower
507|google|pros|The best company I have been to! Learnt a lot and I love the working environment.
507|google|cons|Very big company. Hard to be visible and remember people that you have worked with.
508|google|pros|Really intelligent people to work with, great infrastructure and tools, focus on excellence.
508|google|cons|Traffic into work can be discouraging.
509|google|pros|Incredibly smart coworkers, best tools I've ever used, silly offices, free food, one project can affect millions of people and dollars.
509|google|cons|Imposter syndrome. For me, long commute. Twenty percent time is hard to make time for. The delicious food will make you fat.
510|google|pros|Seemingly unlimited resources; work with top/diverse talent from across the globe; amazing perks from food to testing of prototype consumer technologies.
510|google|cons|Extremely competitive; take home pay is not as high as non-Googlers assume it is; many poorly socialized individuals around.
511|google|pros|Everyone is vibrant and high-energy. Truly a fun place to get your nerd on. Oh and we do work sometimes. The campus is huge and contains many perks such as a gym and cafeteria.
511|google|cons|The projects are fast paced so be prepared. We work nonstop although it's not always a serious environment. During breaks we tend to avoid talking about work because we are always so busy with it.
512|google|pros|Smart people who are passionate about their job.
512|google|cons|Tons of bureaucracy. Promotions are made unnecessarily difficult.
513|google|pros|There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield).
513|google|cons|The company is becoming bigger and bigger each year, which brings on its own problems.
514|google|pros|Super smart people, engineering culture.
514|google|cons|Not too many career advance opportunities.
515|google|pros|great teams and location and food

516|google|cons|Can't think of any at the moment
517|google|pros|Amazing place to work - great people and great benefits
517|google|cons|This is not a place to coast - come ready to make a difference.
518|google|pros|Exciting to work in a company that powers billions of people's lives everyday.
518|google|cons|Becoming more conventional as size grows with a limited scope of what one can do.
519|google|pros|+ Awesome projects
519|google|cons|- Size of the company is huge, so don't expect startup culture.
520|google|pros|Very impactful work, great coworkers, good work-life balance, some interesting projects.
520|google|cons|Due to the size of the company, different divisions of Google have different cultures. It can be hard for job applicants to know which divisions they want to work in.
521|google|pros|There benifits are good,and it will bring you a lot of good things for your family.
521|google|cons|Good company ever...i recomment to any one who is currently looking for there good job.
522|google|pros|Google is the best company to work for. The perks are amazing, every detail is considered! The work is interesting and colleagues smart and fun to work with.
522|google|cons|It can be a little intimidating when everyone is at the top of their game. When everyone's a high performer it's very hard to stand out.
523|google|pros|"Google deserves every bit of its ""Best Company to Work For"" reputation. My own experience was in getting to build a business from scratch inside the company and watching it flourish."
523|google|cons|"The bureaucracy and big company feel is starting to creep in. Despite a ""Bureaucracy Busters"" campaign, there are days I feel like I am attaching a cover sheet to my TPS report."
524|google|pros|Good infrastructure, good people to work with, nice perks.
524|google|cons|The company is too big to get anything done reasonably easy.
525|google|pros|Amazing benefits, good pay, extremely intelligent people, engaging work that impacts a lot of people. Managers are competent, and promotion is meritocratic.
525|google|cons|Main offices are in expensive areas. Oncall rotations interfere with work-life balance.
526|google|pros|Great perks. Flexible schedule. Meet great people.
526|google|cons|To many managers. To many meetings. Favoritism place a huge role with management.
527|google|pros|There are so many great benefits at Google. Food, exercise classes, and the work spaces are just great. Great sense of freedom and that you are in control of what you're working on
527|google|cons|Google is a huge company. Sometimes feels like you get lost in what you're doing. Great company but definitely feels big.
528|google|pros|Tons of perks, good pay. If you have the chance, it's worth working there and experiencing it!
528|google|cons|Workload can be daunting at times, FTE's and TVC's are viewed VERY differently in the culture.
529|google|pros|Friendly and competitive environment,unlimited food and perks.I have worked for google more than 3 years and always felt this place like my second home.
529|google|cons|Work during weekends,nothing particular.
530|google|pros|- Extremely smart and nice people
530|google|cons|- Mature products move slow due to size and complexity
531|google|pros|Great smart people. All the usual perks
531|google|cons|Flat structure means career movement can be difficult
532|google|pros|Great place as long as your team is good. If your team is not that good, you always have the option to switch.
532|google|cons|Career growth depends heavily on team and manager.
533|google|pros|I learn a lot. Google pays for my Masters degree at Stanford.
533|google|cons|My teammates are not great at English, and sometimes results in miscommunication. It's a team-specific problem though, my other Googler friends don't have this problem.
534|google|pros|Huge Impact, lots of interesting people you work with, people get excited every time you mention you work there. Overall though I really enjoyed working there and would recommend.
534|google|cons|Lots of management overhead, does move slowly, especially on the engineering side, which means you sometimes have to sit on your hands. Also there's a decent amount of back and forth from middle management on direction.
535|google|pros|You will learn more here than anywhere else you've worked.
535|google|cons|Work life Balance
536|google|pros|Great coworkers and a ton of opportunities.
536|google|cons|It is too boring to work there.
537|google|pros|Very friendly people and very interesting work. The working environment is very nice and we only need to worry about work we are responsible for, and anything else is well taken care of by other assistants and applications.
537|google|cons|A common problem with large companies: it is a lot competition to climb up the latter from an ordinary engineer.
538|google|pros|- Access to a vast wealth of technical resources and people
538|google|cons|- Given large size of company, often easy to get lost among thousands of other employees.
539|google|pros|Huge resources available, world-class brilliant people to work with. Great place to learn how to scale real-world systems.
539|google|cons|It has become a big company. It's leaner and less bureaucratic than most big companies, but it's still a big company.
540|google|pros|It's a good company, good place to work and good place to learn.
540|google|cons|Nothing specific, haven't had any issues working here.
541|google|pros|Good opportunities, mobility, good reward
541|google|cons|Company is very very big
542|google|pros|Everything you've ever heard about working at Google is true. Benefits are awesome, coworkers are awesome, and your work affects millions of people.
542|google|cons|Politics are starting to get in the way of engineering. Since launches are incentivized so heavily in promo process, negative dogfood feedback is often ignored on the way to launch, with few or no consequences.
543|google|pros|Great perks, amazing technology, inspiring activities
543|google|cons|Very biased towards whatever engineering wants, creating unfair conditions for everyone else.
544|google|pros|The company offers generous perks. The locations of headquarters and other offices are great.
544|google|cons|Associate directors, directors, and senior directors are engaged in political battles. Promotions are very political
545|google|pros|great environment and place to work
545|google|cons|hours can be long sometimes
546|google|pros|Food, Google Bus, Great culture, upward mobility, independent office hours
546|google|cons|Not in San Francisco, traffic getting worse, sometimes too focused internally
547|google|pros|Work with top notch people and learn how to build product for millions of users.
547|google|cons|Not a small company. It's slow to deploy product changes and as a product person you'll spend way more time building consensus and getting approval for launching something than actually building the product.
548|google|pros|Google is still full of bright motivated people, working on world-class products. The company is led by solid people, who truly care about continuing to make the world a better place.
548|google|cons|The company is a lot bigger than it used to be, and though it's done better than most, it can't help slowing down as it grows. Some of the reasons I came to work at Google when it was 1000 employees are no longer true.
549|google|pros|Awesome benefits and ability to work remotely or from other offices, free food is a major plus as well
549|google|cons|Most jobs are in MTV where cost of living is extremely high even when making almost $100K
550|google|pros|great work environment
550|google|cons|long hours but I think everything makes up for it
551|google|pros|hard to get in
551|google|cons|nice salary and internal work environment
552|google|pros|Google is as advertised - it's an amazing place to work full of incredibly smart people working on interesting and challenging problems. The pay and perks are great. In theory there is a lot of opportunity for mobility and Google does seem committed to developing people over the course of their careers.
552|google|cons|Some Googlers are incredibly entitled and complain about mundane issues. It's less nimble than it used to be. Certain organizations (People Operations) are bureaucratic and very top-down in leadership style, which is antithetical to the way Google portrays itself.
553|google|pros|Google was a great company to work.
553|google|cons|It is too comfortable. You must get out of comfort zones. It might be a great company to work. But remember every big company in the past such as Microsoft was like that.
554|google|pros|Great Learning Opportunities
554|google|cons|Difficult Work but worth the challenge
555|google|pros|Its a fun place to work
555|google|cons|Some people take advantage of it too much
556|google|pros|Flexible hours, awesome benefits, amazing coworkers!
556|google|cons|Work was hard but fair. Sometimes the work felt like it never ended.
557|google|pros|Work with the smartest people. Fast paced. Challenging.
557|google|cons|Will burn you out. Gives whatever you are willing to sacrifice.
558|google|pros|strong financial, lavish perks, smart people to learn from
558|google|cons|little impact, small rolls, politics, people just waiting for retirement there
559|google|pros|Google is probably the best corporate environment to work in. A lot of opportunities to get exposed to things outside of your immediate job. Strong brand allows you to open many doors. Of course the perks have
559|google|cons|Google is far from being a startup and it slowly becomes more and more corporate. Selecting a team and evaluating its culture before joining becomes more important to make sure your expectations match your team's.
560|google|pros|1. Work with smart people in a great company
560|google|cons|1. Limited impact.
561|google|pros|Very creative atmosphere, and the quality of people you work with is noticeably better than anywhere else.
561|google|cons|I can't think of any yet, other than all the cons that go with working for a Big Corporate Machine.
562|google|pros|google has a very flexible culture. You can benefits from learning experience from other geeks.
562|google|cons|Since it is already a huge company. So probably some of the projects at google are not as challenging as before. If you want to solve challenging problem, then it's not the perfect place.
563|google|pros|great place to work as a fulltime/intern
563|google|cons|can not think of any
564|google|pros|Some of the best perks in the industry.
564|google|cons|The office politics are harsh.
565|google|pros|Great people (generally smart, friendly, and hard-working)
565|google|cons|Lack of opportunity for senior talent (staff and above) to really make a dent in the organization. This, coupled with the very slow promo process (1.5 years / level) and Google's tendency to downlevel on hire can be very frustrating. To some extent, I felt like I had to simply wait for leadership to retire or play the political game to get much further in my career.
566|google|pros|Good benefits, Smart people, great culture
566|google|cons|Ambiguous environment, not easy to navigate for a lot of ppl
567|google|pros|Talented people, interesting projects, good perks and benefits.
567|google|cons|Big big big - lots of politics/ nothing moves. Leadership skills of leaders on average is low since tech acumen valued by leadership is not.
568|google|pros|It was great. It was a different time but it was great.
568|google|cons|A little scattered at times. This was part of the fun.
569|google|pros|Overall work and life balance is promoted through various incentives. The people are bright and great to work with. Free breakfast and lunch! Google offers multiple perks. There's interest groups for about anything, volunteering opportunities, and projects outside your domain expertise to get involved with. You have a portal to learn various skills on your own or on your expertise at about anytime as long as you sign… Show More
569|google|cons|Communication between team members out side of the weekly team meeting had no consistency.Team is separated into focus areas specialized for each member and the overall team which can have constraints for those who are not self thought or self starters. Team may feel distant at times if it's divided by offices. Expect to hit the workload at light speed while making sure you are ALWAYS on top of everything so that it'… Show More
570|google|pros|Even though I am not an employee of Google, I still get many of the perks like food and coffee and the gym
570|google|cons|The company is getting so big that standards can be different from org to org causing confusion for employees
571|google|pros|Colleagues and managers were extremely supportive
571|google|cons|Lots of bureaucracy, which is normal and expected for such a large company
572|google|pros|Salary and benefits are decent
572|google|cons|Unless you are level 5+ your opinion is meaningless
573|google|pros|Incredibly brilliant people, very comfortable amenities and perks. The opportunity to solve (mostly) really interesting challenges and problems at a HUGE scale.
573|google|cons|Your experience varies so much based on your team and who your manager is. More training needed for people to actually manage and get the most out of people. Great perks don't make up for the other parts.
574|google|pros|- Work is technically challenging. Not incremental stuff, 50% devoted to ambitious work
574|google|cons|- Work with very talented/ambitious people who will not tolerate shoddy work
575|google|pros|food, intelligent people, great access to resource and mentors
575|google|cons|basically none, it was great
576|google|pros|It's Google after all! I had a great time working there and my co-workers were quite supportive.
576|google|cons|The workload was quite heavy and sometime I had to work late nights.
577|google|pros|- Work with top coders on the planet.
577|google|cons|Workload can be daunting at times when you want to just sit back and relax. Not really that place unless you are super smart.
578|google|pros|Free food- they have professional chefs
578|google|cons|Politics - too much focus on titles and ranks sucking up to other people
579|google|pros|Great culture.
579|google|cons|As the company grew bigger, politics started trickling in.
580|google|pros|perks (lots of free stuff)
580|google|cons|getting larger, more bureaucratic
581|google|pros|Great food. Smart coworkers. Nice weather.
581|google|cons|This depends on the person.

583|google|cons|poor training, some lack of direction and understanding
584|google|pros|Independent working ethics for staff
584|google|cons|projects can easily be shut down
585|google|pros|nice people, and great benefits
585|google|cons|difficult to transition full-time for most
586|google|pros|If is full time could be perfect
586|google|cons|Is perfect it doesn't have any negative
587|google|pros|During the time I was at Google, I have had the pleasure to work with smart, savvy, and dedicated people who truly have passions for what we do - it is contagious.
587|google|cons|Nothing really major from my opinion.
588|google|pros|All benefits on food, drink. Well life-work balance and provide good environment to work.

591|google|cons|Dont want to leave some days
592|google|pros|Great people, awesome culture (people are Googley), gourmet food.
592|google|cons|Advancement is a bit hit and miss. You can get stuck on a dead-end project (and there are surprisingly many of those at Google).
593|google|pros|A lot of freedom for charting your own path. A lot more encouragement to make yourself productive than being pressured to be productive.
593|google|cons|The size of the company shows. You have to work at group speed, mostly think and work the group way. Slow growth curve.
594|google|pros|Great area and good pay
594|google|cons|Lots of competition and hard to move up
595|google|pros|free food management cares about their employees.
595|google|cons|Working with too many talented and creative people can result in clashing of the minds

603|google|cons|Can get hectic at times
604|google|pros|A lot of responsibility. Exciting. Fantastically smart, capable, and fun colleagues. Great salary and benefits. Lots of international travel. Entrepreneurial culture.
604|google|cons|In general: a lot of people are slacking at the moment. They don't really care about what they're doing. Company lacks proper processes, accountability, and avoids conflict to the point that it languishes dangerously.
605|google|pros|Super smart people, great infrastructure, access to lots of users. Potential for big impact.
605|google|cons|Lots of inertia, due to size. Bureaucratic and political.
606|google|pros|Lots of things to learn. Free food, gyms, bike, shuttle, laundry; smart people, now, what else do I miss?
606|google|cons|There are lots of different internal systems which you can build things upon. But the learning curve is steep - take a long time to ramp up.
607|google|pros|fun and intellectually stimulating work environment, great people
607|google|cons|big organization and it's hard to get noticed
608|google|pros|Access/exposure to a lot of cool projects before they are widely known to the public and your foot in the door to landing a full time position with the company
608|google|cons|"The program was very unstructured. A lot of us were confused what were could and couldn't do after ""orientation."" If you ask me, a lot of the events hosted by ambassadors representing the company were poorly run/planned which in turn made the company look bad (some ambassadors did a better job than others)"
609|google|pros|this job has really given me insight out the job game really works. I learned how to develop software in my spare time and always love the cafeteria
609|google|cons|there is really no downside to Google. As an employee, I have access to resources and great training and coaching. Please hire my friends as well.
610|google|pros|I worked at Google for over 7 years. It is the longest that I have worked at any company. That is a testimonial to how good the company is! I left Google because I wanted to try my hand at starting my own company or joining an early stage start up.
610|google|cons|Over the years, Google has become more bureaucratic. Unfortunately, several groups are working in the same area and the usual turf battles happen. Also, it has become harder to change projects than before.
611|google|pros|Work with some of the smartest and most creative talent around, contribute to a company that makes a significant impact in the daily lives of billions of users, enjoy all the amazing benefits and perks.
611|google|cons|The large size of the company has produced bureaucracy and several layers of teams/departments/orgs that can slow down decision making and progress.
612|google|pros|Very good working environment, smart people, great benefit. Also a very good work - life balance
612|google|cons|Starts to become a little bit too big and is more like a big corporation now..
613|google|pros|Great benefits, surrounded by smart/motivated people, lots of perks, locations around the world, 401K match, health benefits are outstanding
613|google|cons|Getting way to big. Levels are everything to everyone. Lower pay than other startups. Inequity of treatment between the sales side and the engineering side of the businesses.
614|google|pros|Amazing place to learn, grow, and have a scaled impact
614|google|cons|Large, corporate, and difficult to rise up after a certain point in your career
615|google|pros|The culture is amazing! What you read in the articles about the perks and people is absolutely true. It's great to work at a company that offers 3 meals a day Monday-Friday, where I feel comfortable around 100% of the people and where you have the ability to make your own schedule.
615|google|cons|Google is still a big and established company. There will still be a corporate hierarchy that will take months or years to change compared to quick feedback within a startup.
616|google|pros|Good for most of the things
616|google|cons|Meal, policy. and so on
617|google|pros|Getting to work for Google. Great culture outside of the ITRP program.
617|google|cons|They will lie to recruit you, and promise training, ops roations, and learning opportunities that never happen.
618|google|pros|All of the perks are incredible!
618|google|cons|The commute is tough from SF
619|google|pros|Google spoils its employees. Free breakfast lunch and dinner, great amenities, and budgets never seem to be an issue (at other jobs I've had to beg travel budget -- at Google, I can pretty much take any trip I think is worthwhile). They also do tons to reduce friction as an employee.
619|google|cons|It *is* a big company. Things don't turn on a dime; there is a lot of process. And it is *very* engineering directed.
620|google|pros|Whatever you can think of! I feel like a king when I'm at work. I absolutely love my job!!!!
620|google|cons|The traffic can get really nasty and the housing prices are just unbelievably high, but the whole bay area has such problems and has nothing to do with the company

621|google|cons|The traffic can get really nasty and the housing prices are just unbelievably high, but the whole bay area has such problems and has nothing to do with the company

623|google|pros|The perks are amazing!

624|google|pros|Great place to work love it
624|google|cons|no feedback to give. super good workplace
625|google|pros|Amazing people and atmosphere. Crazy good benefits.
625|google|cons|Not a single con working here.
626|google|pros|lots of new projects and good team to work with..
626|google|cons|cant say anything of that kind
627|google|pros|great company, had an amazing time and learned a lot. look forward to going back. super fun people and had a very good time. love google. love it so much
627|google|cons|cons are that there are absolutely no cons but google is life and without it we wouldnt be alive today so thank you google and everything you do. you are life.
628|google|pros|- Very smart people
628|google|cons|- Bureaucracy, politics, legal issues, and privacy handling take up more and more time over the years and slow innovation and development.
629|google|pros|Flexible, lots of opportunities, good environment.
629|google|cons|Everything is good, infrastructure is the best.
630|google|pros|great company to work for
630|google|cons|getting very large in size
631|google|pros|"The work culture is excellent; being nice to others is rewarded socially, and economically. The projects are incredibly diverse, and challenging. And the compensation and perks are very generous. As the person leading the orientation told me on my first day: ""We want you to be happy. If you're happy you're more productive."" I'm happy indeed :)"
631|google|cons|Work-life balance can be difficult, not necessarily due to management asking you to work off-hours, but because sometimes it's hard to disconnect.
632|google|pros|you can work on what you want to work on
632|google|cons|felt like a little cog in the machine
633|google|pros|Great perks, very smart people, great atmosphere, good leadership. Overall, very nice company to work for and a lot to learn from. Good compensation doesn't hurt.
633|google|cons|Sometimes people can get overly competitive. While it's good to have many young people in the company, some are arrogant and entitled. Depending on the group, some could have fratty culture.
634|google|pros|+ Stable job
634|google|cons|+ Finance team full of mediocre people especially at the top- these are people who joined Google when finance@Google was not a great option and then these people just rode the wave.
635|google|pros|Free food, good infrastructure, mostly great people, mission, if you can get into a team that actually has a mission. Good pay, though no longer the best. Engineers still (mostly) run things there. It's easy to switch projects if you perform well and opportunities are actually available (which is not a given, especially in remote offices). It also feels like the company actually gives a damn about making the front li… Show More
635|google|cons|"Way too much middle management and hierarchy, mostly incompetent lower level management (it's a quick way to get promoted when you're out of steam technically you start going to a bunch of meetings and become a TLM), little to no opportunity for advancement as individual contributor, super-competitive atmosphere, very little recognition is general, since your ""very best"" is ""meh"" there.

636|google|pros|Perfect Salary, work enviroment
636|google|cons|san francisco is very expensive, although I was making a lot of money I ended up spending all of it. Hard to find right place to live
637|google|pros|good pay, perks
637|google|cons|can be stressful at times
638|google|pros|Work life balance is great. Free food.
638|google|cons|Free food but not great. Perks are not easy to understand.
639|google|pros|Free food, smart people, great pay, exciting work! The bay area has beautiful weather as well which is a bonus
639|google|cons|It is hard to advance up the mangement chain because people here are so smart. Might be better fit to work at a smaller company
640|google|pros|The perks are legendary here. Contrary to rumors, the food quality is still very good, some of the newer cafes on the main campus get rave reviews. Get to work with lots of very smart people, with mostly good attitudes. Very academic atmosphere where research and analysis of data is the preferred way to guide decisions.
640|google|cons|"Very crowded campuses, easy to feel lost in a sea of employees. Free food, but nowhere to sit down and eat it. Not always easy to spend time on ""20 percent time"" projects as advertised. Lots of internal bureaucracy, surveys, and distractions of optional employee-oriented programs. Self-promotion is encouraged, so prepare to toot your own horn and compete for recognition of your project if you want to get promoted"
641|google|pros|Lots of opensource , good environment
641|google|cons|food is not good. tasty is not good too.
642|google|pros|You'll be surrounded by very smart people, which helps your professional growth; compensation & benefits make you feel valued by the company
642|google|cons|Because there are so many smart people, the company can hire overqualified people for a given position, which can ultimately adversely impact job satisfaction
643|google|pros|Great coworkers, detailed docs and a lot of learning materials to help you become a good engineer.
643|google|cons|1. There is not so much work to do.
644|google|pros|Google is a great company at the forefront of technological advancement. The pay and hours are good and the work culture is laid back.
644|google|cons|There are enough talented people that being talented won't guarantee you an inside track on good projects, because there are thousands of equally smart people ahead in the queue and equally underutilized, but there are just enough bozos that you have to prove that you're not one of them
645|google|pros|Product and tech leadership are outstanding, no one else is doing what Google is and succeeding.
645|google|cons|Sales / business side is becoming political, zero sum game and bureaucratic.
646|google|pros|Great people, lots of perks, awesome benefits, global scope.
646|google|cons|Bureaucracy, challenges to promotion, competitive.
647|google|pros|Tremendous opportunity to learn and develop a deep understanding of how global scale technologies and companies need to work.
647|google|cons|Huge scale can be overwhelming
648|google|pros|Growth potential, benefits, innovation, community contribution, health care,
648|google|cons|I can not think of any
649|google|pros|I've gone from a new grade hire to the tech lead of a 8 person team in 2 1/2 years, and I've learned a ton along the way. Not every engineer you'll work with is amazing, some are just good, and a few are mediocre. However, so many are amazing that it's an absolute pleasure to work on the same codebase as they do.
649|google|cons|Mountain View-centric attitude leads to extreme commute times. This is the largest negative about working here, and I probably would have left by now if I wasn't able to work from home or the SF office most of the week. I'm sure if you live in boring suburbia it'd be fine, but I don't want to do that.
650|google|pros|Every perk you can imagine!
650|google|cons|Company is getting too big to maintain well-known culture standards
651|google|pros|good working environment, handsome salary,good growth and free lunch. you will learn lot of new things, diverse working environment.
651|google|cons|no cons as it is good company
652|google|pros|Great benefits, work life balance, growth opportunities. Promoted to lead expansion in new geos within 2 years. Fun outings and team building
652|google|cons|Bureaucracy at times like any other companies. Consensus driven culture. Senior management is sometimes managing up rather than down, which can be frustrating
653|google|pros|Great place to work and build your career.
653|google|cons|Too much Work!
654|google|pros|Great environment, lots of opportunities
654|google|cons|None that i can think of.
655|google|pros|Lots of accomplished and diverse engineers around you, best practices are very refined, mentorship and sense of community between teams and buildings is very strong if you are willing to participate!
655|google|cons|so large scale (hopefully more addressable with the new restructuring) that similar projects spawn at different offices that couldve been better generalized and collaborated on if there had been a better platform for discovering ongoing or pitched projects. Had a very positive experience with my first internship, but my second felt more overbearing and too broad to be polished on delivery by the end of my internship.… Show More
656|google|pros|Lots of perks - amazing free food, micro kitchens stocked with snacks and any kind of beverage you'd want, baristas, fitness center, subsidized massages and more. They compensation is generous and most of the employees are very fun, nice and smart.
656|google|cons|-There is not a lot of opportunity in the Cambridge office to advance for non-engineering positions
657|google|pros|Perks are too many to mention and with so many smart people to follow around you're going to learn a lot!
657|google|cons|For most I think the small impact you can make, because there is so much talent there and roles can be narrowly defined.
658|google|pros|Google has the clout and money necessary to provide all the resources necessary to succeed.
658|google|cons|"I guess I didn't drink the Kool-Aid. Google has been a major success story in building the web into what it is today. However, most of the management and employees have fallen in love with their own intelligence. This is very bad news for the future growth of the company. Additionally, Google is very risk adverse no matter that they have a ""moonshot"" factory. They don't stick to their goals when there are set backs."
659|google|pros|Great culture, it's up to you to make your impact, amazing technology, treat us like adults, food's awesome, total comp is really great (current stock price really helps!)
659|google|cons|Things change so quickly that it can be difficult to figure out the right way to get something done. Tools get deprecated so quickly that it's a constant race to make sure valuable tools continue to get updated and work. Growing fast so office space is really becoming an issue.
660|google|pros|* Friendly and smart co worker
660|google|cons|* Its a big company, a little bureaucracy is creeping in.
661|google|pros|Lots of mobility, opportunities to be creative and take the lead.
661|google|cons|With the company being so large, sometimes it's difficult to get significant recognition of novel work.
662|google|pros|Great place to work at. Literally has everything you need to work, eat, and play.
662|google|cons|There are no cons with Google. This is the best company in the world.
663|google|pros|I was experiencing great fulfillment working for such great Company, using my linguistic skills and Italian culture in a multicultural environment.
663|google|cons|Salary compensation was unsatisfying and inadequate for the high quality professional performances provided.
664|google|pros|Great culture. Company really puts employee first.
664|google|cons|Getting bigger with more hierarchy.
665|google|pros|flexible working hours and the work-life balance
665|google|cons|you cannot make intelligent decisions
666|google|pros|Great place to work, lots of places to eat and drink
666|google|cons|Too many people, too many visitors
667|google|pros|it was awesome I really liked the culture of Google. I loved coming to work everyday.
667|google|cons|I don't really see any cons of working at google. I decided to leave because I wanted to be closer to my family
668|google|pros|Great coworkers, lots of opportunities
668|google|cons|Harder to transfer between roles
669|google|pros|Culture, people, great benefits and perks, competitive compensation

671|google|pros|Great people, Great culture and Wonderful opportunities.
671|google|cons|Too many great people. Too many debates on the scope of the product.
672|google|pros|Constant change
672|google|cons|Constant change (depends on how you look at it, I see it as a positive)
673|google|pros|great perks and great work environment.
673|google|cons|small fish in a big sea.
674|google|pros|Open culture; fast moving; dynamic; ambitious; lots of perks; strong culture
674|google|cons|getting very large and a bit bureaucratic, certain parts of the company can be political; less opportunities for people at the director level and up. Certain parts of the business - like Android and Play - have little work / life balance. Little appreciation of marketing in certain businesses that are entrenched monopolies.
675|google|pros|Excellent pay and benefits (by far the best software engineering pay I've seen in the Boston area). Higher bonus and stock than anywhere else, too.
675|google|cons|Can be hard to feel like you're making an impact or get recognition in such a large company, especially a remote office.
676|google|pros|Smart and engaging coworkers, free food/beverages, free transportation, free parking, access to Google events, free massages
676|google|cons|Expected to work at maintain quick pace, even for sales. The pace makes it difficult to enjoy all of the pros listed above.
677|google|pros|Good perks, food, general Google lifestyle
677|google|cons|Bad middle management, political, slow moving
678|google|pros|Culture of innovation, appreciation for strong performance, high value placed on quality managers.
678|google|cons|As the company grows, it takes longer to make decisions and get things done.
679|google|pros|1. The job is challenging and you get to learn.
679|google|cons|1. Promotion is hard. It depends on not only your performance, but also how your team's status, and some relatively random decision.
680|google|pros|Free food, nice environment, decent salary, good company reputation, and a lot more great things.
680|google|cons|Overall great experience, haven't found any.

681|google|cons|Overall great experience, haven't found any.
682|google|pros|-Amazing coworkers and teammates
682|google|cons|-Navigating career changes internally can be challenging. Just because you're at the company doesn't mean the process is necessarily easier for changing roles
683|google|pros|Google has a very open culture. Granted, being a large company, its ideals aren't always met, but the the culture of the company is to constantly strive to meet them. Among all the current large companies in the world, the culture is vastly superior.
683|google|cons|It spoils you. If you ever leave, it would be very hard to work somewhere else.
684|google|pros|Google offers real challenge to employees that want to work hard
684|google|cons|Working hard can include long hours, weekends, accommodating global timezones and other difficulties. This is not a 9-5 company. Moving up can be incredibly slow.
685|google|pros|Good food. Good co-workers, Opportunities to leave the comapny
685|google|cons|Work and life balance, no time off, the future of the company is all based on moonshots. The core products are doing well, but could have the stool pulled from under them at any moment.
686|google|pros|Opportunity to grow, training and integrity, people will feel good about themselg
686|google|cons|Diversity of employee not close to home or lack of individual recognition.

687|google|cons|No cons that I can think of
688|google|pros|They fly you out to Mountain View HQ over summer to get trained for a few days. You learn about the Google culture, explore their offices, and have fun with the other Ambassadors. All the Ambassadors stay in a hotel. During the daytime, you have a bunch of workshops at the offices and free food. At night you go back to the hotels and PARTY! Jk, well you can. Oh and everything is ALL EXPENSE PAID!
688|google|cons|They dont really give you that much spending money during the school year for your marketing events. Communication is very poor during the school year as well.
689|google|pros|Google is a good place to work with free food and great perks. the 20% time to work on own projects is a bit blown though
689|google|cons|This company is going the big wigs way. The 20% time to work on own projects is over blown and you really dont get this much time.

691|google|cons|It's be come too big and too bureaucratic. Too many rules and red tape to go through to get anything done, even when trying to change roles or projects. HR is too diplomatic, not really interested in helping employees, they're more concern about preventing Google from being sued. Google's annual survey is there, but haven't seen anything come of it.

693|google|cons|Some of the people are rude and don't listen to you so just make sure to select the right teammates in your groups.
694|google|pros|(1) Countless perks that probably adds 20% to your base salary (including free food, transportation, gym, dance/sports classes, etc)

696|google|pros|Lots of potential for learning on exciting projects

Local and Global perks including discounts on EVERYTHING much li… Show More
697|google|cons|Some real politics are going on these days. You will find the global business organization (their sales division) is more risk averse and people can be back-stabbing in your own team to get political gain. The performance review process is very flawed. They don't tell you what goes into it and therefore you may or may not get promoted and don't know why. Play the politics game and that will help you win. Make up infl… Show More
698|google|pros|Great Company. The food is amazing. The people are brilliant, and the passion is palpable!
698|google|cons|There is a lot of flux at the company (re-orgs on a regular basis), which makes it hard to keep your feet under you. Working at Google and excelling means either being really flexible and quick, or being inflexible and driving forward with your projects no matter the environment.
699|google|pros|Great benefits and friendly people. Never had a terrible day here.
699|google|cons|Expensive area to live in
700|google|pros|Great benefits, opportunity to work with smart individuals. NYC building is gorgeous.
700|google|cons|Incredibly competitive environment translates into always having to 'watch your back.' Based on my experience, I would say the Engineer culture is very different from the Sales/Business culture. The Sales/Business culture can be stodgy, dry, and incredibly 'corporate.' Training can be very difficult to find at times, which ultimately slows down ramp-up time.
701|google|pros|Working for a company that has massive scale, reach, and a positive influence on people every day. Transparency from the very top down. Opportunities to work with brilliant minds.
701|google|cons|It's a large company, and like any big company, there can be bureaucracy. Commuting to Mountain View can be a bit of a drag.
702|google|pros|All the benefits are amazing.
702|google|cons|The sheer size of the company can be a bit aggravating sometimes. Along with the entitlement. Work-life was not particularly good at times.
703|google|pros|Free food, great benefits, flexible work environment.
703|google|cons|Competitive, because everyone you work with is also very talented.
704|google|pros|Nothing to add here unfortunately

705|google|pros|Living the Google life.

In People ops, theres Google is full of corporate politics, as well as a changing culture. Google recruiting is now full of people who push buttons.

707|google|cons|You're a small fish in a big pond. Easy for some people to coast and get lost in the crowd. The work you are doing likely has very little impact on the overall company.
708|google|pros|Google is perhaps the best big corporation you can work for which is well known so I don't have to write much here.

714|google|cons|Its gotten too big. Politics and bureacracy have become significant problems.
715|google|pros|There is always fascinating, challenging work to do and plenty of opportunity to improve professional skills. We have the resources we need to achieve our goals. We enjoy excellent benefits, and the over-all compensation packages are terrific. It is possible to achieve a healthy work-life balance.
715|google|cons|Google is continuing to grow and as we do, it is increasingly bureaucratic... the quality of senior leaders is now uneven, and there is a level of uncertainty about the company's direction from senior executives.
716|google|pros|Amazing benefits, especially insurance and maternity leave

721|google|cons|Google's hiring process is a bear, which made it very difficult as a recruiter. Making meaningful and non-trivial suggestions often fell on deaf ears.
722|google|pros|There were a lot of perks, everyone raves about the breakfast, lunch and dinner. I guess it really helps with your productivity
722|google|cons|It was hard to balance my duties at work with time away from work in my personal life. I was constantly on and needed to put out fires
723|google|pros|Good work life balance.
723|google|cons|Google has grown big and its hard to find your place.
724|google|pros|Fast Smart Rewarding People Location
724|google|cons|Big Getting Slower Policy Parking
725|google|pros|Great Food, Perks and Benefits
725|google|cons|Lots of change constantly occuring
726|google|pros|Great place to be great job
726|google|cons|Not a single thing I can think of
727|google|pros|Free, heathy food offerings, good benefits package
727|google|cons|Too many middle managers with lack of focus, start projects and then quickly abandon them, open discrimination of women, disabled and minorities.
728|google|pros|Google paid very well overall as long as you can pass the interviews.
728|google|cons|It may be some boring in Google recent years.
729|google|pros|the company has great perks and snacks
729|google|cons|nothing bad to say about the company
730|google|pros|Tales of terrible work-life balance are exaggerated, tales of lavish benefits are not. 9-5 or 10-6 are pretty standard working hours, although some choose to work longer.
730|google|cons|The open office layout is noisy and distracting - it's possible to cope, but I really wish we had separate cubes or offices.
731|google|pros|The best company in the world
732|google|pros|Smart and interesting people. Great culture. Engineers rule. Fun work environment. Pretty open and transparent leadership. Clear career paths that strive to be a meritocracy. Yummy free food and snacks. I enjoyed my time there.
732|google|cons|There are no other better companies in the world
733|google|pros|Google has amazing benefits and perks, a lively social atmosphere, and some of the most talented and bright sales people you'll meet
733|google|cons|It's a huge company. That means you won't always feel special like I have working at smaller startups. That also means that it's hard to generalize about the company. Life can be very different for you depending on your team and role.
734|google|pros|Good people. great work environment.
734|google|cons|Management is hit and miss, there are lots of organizational restructures in the sales/marketing teams and it can feel chaotic, many of the pain points you'd expect working for a big corporation
735|google|pros|We made the best tacos
735|google|cons|intern work may not be valuable to the company. fortunately mine was production
736|google|pros|Great people to work with.
736|google|cons|Did not allow sleeping on the job
737|google|pros|work life balance. good working environment
737|google|cons|Work culture, salary, benefits, trainings and poor communication.
738|google|pros|Working in a company that makes amazing products, having access to amazing people, and being able to affect technology that will have an impact.
738|google|cons|sometimes over time working. Normal salary
739|google|pros|work-life balance, perks/benefits, impactful work, job security
739|google|cons|It is easy to get lost and overwhelmed if you do not have a clear role and desire to continuously grow. If you get complacent or if you do not pay attention to surrounding teams, you probably will not be there long.
740|google|pros|Easy to recruiter folks when you have a big brand like Google behind you. My manager was generally available and was great about internal mobility.
740|google|cons|no longer a flat structure, sometimes too hierarchical, HR too involved
741|google|pros|nothing
741|google|cons|Google's hiring process is a bear, which made it very difficult as a recruiter. Making meaningful and non-trivial suggestions often fell on deaf ears.
742|google|pros|Passionate people
742|google|cons|It can be daunting to start since you have to get used to all the tools (there are a lot of tools, especially Google specific tools).
743|google|pros|Wonderful mission from the founders and leaders, which truly trickle down to every aspect of the company. Employees feel connected and included in the amazing contributions made from the entire Google workforce. You can tell that the founders truly do have idealistic notions that permeate the culture and create an atmosphere that is difficult to find and authentically recreate.
743|google|cons|Depending on the department, bureaucracy can quite a problem. There were obvious ways to make things better, but the top leaders were either uninvolved and focused on other 'sexier' projects, or were never given the honest/critical information. Inefficiencies weren't fixed because teams and departments were built around how things worked (not optimally). This led to management pushing and trying to exceed targets in … Show More
744|google|pros|- Velocity
744|google|cons|I cannot think of any.
745|google|pros|Free food, great campus, great space, great people, unlimited resources, always something to do
745|google|cons|It's still a business, there are still offices... you'll never escape some aspects of a typical job
746|google|pros|Google has great coworkers, top-notch hardware and software infrastructure, excellent total compensation, lots of autonomy for workers, and excellent managers.
746|google|cons|Google is a blatantly liberal company.
747|google|pros|cool, smart people, pretty laid back, lots of the perks of being a google employee (e.g. games, lots of free food, etc)
747|google|cons|the management was pretty bad, they didn't really listen to engineers and in particular treated engineering as if they were children
748|google|pros|Loved the people when I started, loved the perks, loved the flexibility and trust in employees. Awesome opportunities for side projects
748|google|cons|Sales team is big and bureaucratic, not startup-like at all. Hard to get out of sales onto other teams. Very few opportunities in Boston due to it being a remote office.
749|google|pros|Good work-life balance. You can easily stay at T5 while working 40 hours a week.
749|google|cons|Bad career path. Most people stop at T5. To reach T6, you have to fight for leadership and ownership.
750|google|pros|Great Benefits, Good Perks, Smart Co-workers
750|google|cons|No Life - Work Balance, Not a Organizational Structure. Process is missing
751|google|pros|Great company to work for, fun times and challenging problems every day of the week. great food also.
751|google|cons|I never had problems there, salary was good not exceptional
752|google|pros|very engaging and creative work
752|google|cons|very competitive and high stress
753|google|pros|Its a great environment and i love it
753|google|cons|great workers and great food
754|google|pros|Great culture, perks, brilliant peers.
754|google|cons|None at all. Can get difficult at times with middle management
755|google|pros|Amazing food, perks, people, etc
755|google|cons|I can not think of anything
756|google|pros|Perks, culture, coworkers are all spectacular
756|google|cons|Management quality depends on your department/product
757|google|pros|really great opportunity to network and meet new people.
757|google|cons|Long hours (55+) as an unpaid intern.
758|google|pros|smart co-workers and they are nice ppl
758|google|cons|some times too much politics
759|google|pros|Culture, people, opportunities, benefits. A lot of the people think Google is all about lava lamps, free food, big pay checks. If Google removes all of it, Google will still be Google
759|google|cons|Hires ex-consultants for operational leadership roles who continue to be consultants than operational leaders (with some exceptions). Not open to leveraging industry best practices and a lot of re-inventions happen for processes that can easily be leveraged from the market. This might be frustrating for folks with significant industry experience.
760|google|pros|great great pay and benefits
760|google|cons|no no cons, nothing negative
761|google|pros|Great work conditions and good atmosphere also really nice benefits. Also the work space is really nice and love the free food
761|google|cons|None the atmosphere is great wonderful work condition and great salery so working at Google is fantastic and very nice co workers
762|google|pros|Smart people
762|google|cons|Company is becoming bigger so there is lot of competition for projects and promotions.
763|google|pros|Excellent first company to join after college. Best launchpad for career.
763|google|cons|Promotions are based on politics. For management & HR: Many TLMs pick favorites and reduce opportunities for others by restricting project allocations. Encourage 6-month transfers to help employees find better and cohesive teams where they will happily remain and let others move. It'll also let bad teams / TLs get smaller and atrophy which is good for Google overall.
764|google|pros|Great campus and intern culture
764|google|cons|The shuttle schedules were sometimes hard to work around
765|google|pros|good easy, fun, good management, smart
765|google|cons|not enough work, not worth it
766|google|pros|free food, massages, co workers and environment
766|google|cons|nothing really except you don't get to choose which state you'd like to be placed in when you're entry level but a great company either way
767|google|pros|Great company, lots of interesting work, great coworkers, upward mobility.
767|google|cons|Frustrating management at times, hard to feel meanginful with so many people, tiring work sometimes.
768|google|pros|Flex time and once you leave work your day is done.
768|google|cons|No room to become full time none contract.. Pay is on the low end.
769|google|pros|awesome people, great perks, best place to launch a career.
769|google|cons|big company, need to learn skills to deal with it.
770|google|pros|Free stuff is pretty awesome
770|google|cons|Hard to go up as a contractor
771|google|pros|Visionary leadership, interesting products, great brand, great perks, very focused on employee development/growth
771|google|cons|As it gets larger, it gets slower, more dysfunctional, less efficient.
772|google|pros|It's Google. You work with smart people, work on interesting projects, and have fantastic perks. Work life balance was surprisingly good.
772|google|cons|Hiring can be a mess and take forever. There's a lot of either deprecated technology in the stack or tech that is not ready to use.
773|google|pros|Imagine a place that you are working with the 20% people all the time, this is how it is working in Google. You can trust your co-working to get their part done almost 90+% of the time without nagging them.
773|google|cons|Still have politics. The company is large, so some things don't get done as quickly. Some overachievers are trying very hard to shine. If you are aggressive and try to climb the corporate ladder than the competition can be tough.
774|google|pros|Great benefits and work-life balance, smart people and interesting products
774|google|cons|Limited career opportunities given size of company.
775|google|pros|work with smart people laid back environment learned a lot.
775|google|cons|last minute unplanned meetings can be a bit frustrating.
776|google|pros|Culture, People, Experience, Mobility, Pace
776|google|cons|Becoming a large corporation with the usual challenges
777|google|pros|Goog knowledge of electrical feed for telecomunications
777|google|cons|A need to improve muy english level , but i have the necessary level to work.
778|google|pros|loved everything about it. was a fun place to work
778|google|cons|none everything was exeptional i had a great time
779|google|pros|Lots of perks: free food, free gym, on site massages, great opportunities to learn about different areas of the business, excellent coworkers-a pleasure to work with most people at Google.
779|google|cons|Work-life balance could be better. Certain projects seem understaffed. Lots of bureaucracy, which can be frustrating to some people. Not too many cons overall
780|google|pros|Google provides an opportunity to work with super smart, engaged people on exciting, fast-moving projects that have a huge impact. The wonderful benefits don't hurt, either.
780|google|cons|"All the frustrations of working in a large, flat organization: especially if you're trying to get anything done cross-functionally, takes awhile to figure out how ""the world works"" and deal with navigating the organizational structure. Where I was in the organization, pace and rapid change of projects could be challenging at times."
781|google|pros|Smart people
781|google|cons|Company is becoming bigger so there is lot of competition for projects and promotions.
782|google|pros|Strong culture, lots of really smart people from whom you can learn a lot. Great resources, every aspect of company is innovative and doesn't settle for OK. Fun environment.
782|google|cons|Big company, outside of your immediate team/department there isn't a strong sense of local community. It's hard to see impact importance of your work if you're in a large organization.
783|google|pros|1. Good procedure
783|google|cons|1. Not too high salary
784|google|pros|Work with really smart, driven people. Product development and managers were top notch. I was able to move around to different teams and global offices every few years -- awesome!
784|google|cons|"There was a growing number of employees that were simply ""resting and vesting"" so it became discouraging for those of us who wanted to make an impact. Felt like it was becoming more about MBAs who know nothing about marketing taking over and ideas were becoming less and less creative. People were less willing to take a risk."
785|google|pros|free snacks
785|google|cons|Long hours
786|google|pros|The work is interesting, and not tedious or boring. The expectations are not unreasonable. There is room to grow, ands expand ones skill set using the 20% time. Coworkers are amazing and one learns a lot. Perks are pretty awesome
786|google|cons|It is hard to get noticed. The imposter syndrome is strong. Promotions require extraordinary work. It really pastas to be self motivating, and self promoting. You need to get decent per reviews from your co workers
787|google|pros|very fun place to work, lots of smart people
787|google|cons|it was a lot of hard work, but thats expected
788|google|pros|it's generous to engineers, and more
788|google|cons|much brain wash, and more
789|google|pros|Good money, good people, good food. Everyone I've worked with at Google has been a pleasure to work with.
789|google|cons|Working for such a large company means it takes longer to get anything done. As an iOS developer, Google does iOS development very differently from other companies. Traffic is a pain getting in and out of campus.
790|google|pros|You can take it easy.
790|google|cons|Job can be repetitive and boring. Nothing new to learn.
791|google|pros|good food and coffee free
791|google|cons|annoying people hipsterish always wants to talk
792|google|pros|Great to stay in google with open atmosphere
792|google|cons|Do not have many opportunities to do something unique
793|google|pros|Bright and engaging people, amazing financial and non-financial benefits, healthy work life balance. Easily the biggest advantage of working at Google is the people; extremely intelligent, team oriented, and genuine.
793|google|cons|Occasional long hours, high achieving culture with fast operations. On the sales/marketing side of the house, it's expected to be constantly connected to, and to have very fast TATs for asks, both client and internal.
794|google|pros|Great benefits and international career opps.
794|google|cons|Middle managment at sales psitions tends to be mediocre.
795|google|pros|The basics, free food, good benefits (but now most tech companies have the same benefits), a lot of good people.
795|google|cons|"No direction, guidance or training. It was literally sink or swim. The content of what we were working on was not interesting or challenging and when tried to shift to other projects, we were told that we could only do this one thing. Usually a good manager will help their employees find a project where they can build their strengths. I think they didn't really care if we left, but thought, ""hey we can always hire mo… Show More"
796|google|pros|Smart coworkers, open culture, many challenging problems, good compensation, many good benefits if you take advantage of them
796|google|cons|Easy to coast, part of a large organism, can become institutionalized
797|google|pros|Great work environment and very much engineering focused
797|google|cons|slow moving bureaucracy does not always react to change
798|google|pros|Lots of autonomy, fun place to work, talented co-workers
798|google|cons|Long time for a hiring decision for MBA full-time and intern roles.
799|google|pros|I'm a loyal worker.
799|google|cons|No downsides to me thinking of work for this company.
800|google|pros|culture, people, benefits - 3 factors that contribute to the low attrition rate because employees enjoy the idea of coming to work and look forward to taking up new challenges
800|google|cons|core values don't always trickle down due to pockets of bad middle management.
801|google|pros|You can achieve great balance between life and work.
801|google|cons|The company is becoming slower.
802|google|pros|Security. Google is a safe bet. Innovation is paced though, as with any developed company. All my time was spent in Google for Work org, which was very different from greater Google and had poor leadership. Was inconsequential enough that greater Google hadn't yet taken notice, but I predict a big shake up soon.
802|google|cons|Opportunity for vertical movement is scarce. Hiring practices have led to hiring candidates based on who has the best resume, rather than who is the best person for the job. Culture of ladder climbing slows down productivity and leads to a lot of people being stepped on.
803|google|pros|Amazing benefits
803|google|cons|Terrible place to commute to if you want to live in San Francisco
804|google|pros|Dynamic, fast-moving company
804|google|cons|Need better communication between engineering and other departments/teams
805|google|pros|It is a fun and exciting place for anybody to work with all the new and exciting things that they envint.
805|google|cons|I would say that the only thing I can say would be a Con working for Google would be if you didn't work for them anymore.
806|google|pros|good work envir, loveit, free food, flexible work hours
806|google|cons|pressure from managers, strict deadlines, no life for social
807|google|pros|So much fun. Great people
807|google|cons|Nothing was really wrong. It was great.
808|google|pros|The perks are awesome, specifically the gourmet food served for breakfast/lunch/dinner 5 days a week. The luxury shuttles are the most comfortable way to make the commute from SF and the 401K/health/dental plans are top notch. Super smart people and lots of projects going on that are changing the world.
808|google|cons|Google is now a large company so there's a fair amount of bureaucracy and processes in place which can slow things down. Promotions are harder to come by but this is natural for any company of this size. Google is heavily email-centric and so you better be ready for 200+ emails a day and sometimes an implicit expectation to be on email during off-hours.
809|google|pros|good experience, good people, good atmosphere, loved my co-workers, can be fun
809|google|cons|hours varied, upper management can be tricky
810|google|pros|Great benefits. The best team I've ever worked with. Lots of team building opportunities.
810|google|cons|Mountain View centric. If you are remote, then your opinion is much less important. Some of the departments are very hierarchical.
811|google|pros|- Free Food!
811|google|cons|- Commute: 1.5 hours is alleviated by riding on the shuttle, but it is still 1.5 hrs.
812|google|pros|It's fun you can do whatever you want. I work on !y own schedule so I have a lot of free time
812|google|cons|I think there are no cons here, unless I lied. And I don't wanna do that
813|google|pros|Smart engineers and brilliant computer science. Great facility. A rich assortment of on-campus perks. The meals. The visiting speakers. And the daily bus service helps tremendously.
813|google|cons|1) Inexperienced and bloated middle management. 2) The white badge vs red badge situation creates conflict within departments. In this employment model, an employee sits next to a contractor, both do the exact same work but the employee gets paid 2x as much and has a full benefits packages.
814|google|pros|Good technology, great people and huge profit from ads
814|google|cons|Some internal group (eg. corp-eng) has management that's not on par with the rest of the company.
815|google|pros|They really care about your personal career path as well as your quality of life, so I got a really kind impression while I was an intern there. I also loved playing volleyball, and the Mountain View campus had great access to sand volleyball courts!
815|google|cons|I don't really have any cons! Maybe the only con was that the food is too good and too plentiful so I gained about 7 lbs during my internship :(
816|google|pros|co-operation, High salary, new technologies ... etc
816|google|cons|very exhausted, less benefits ... etc
817|google|pros|Mentorship is baked into the internship program. My host was great, and we had weekly meetings to review feedback for each other.
817|google|cons|I enjoyed my work but didn't feel like what I was doing was terribly important. I was also working on one of Google's smaller campuses, and there was no intern community there.
818|google|pros|Its a good job with good school medical and dental benefits
818|google|cons|A lot of tedious work and some off the people are not so great
819|google|pros|I felt like the company was truly invested in me (and my professional development) and that the people around me genuinely appreciated my contributions.
819|google|cons|I struggled with finding ways to progress my career and change verticals.
820|google|pros|Cares about employees, self-starter culture
820|google|cons|Sometimes too big and complicated to navigate, very inwardly focused
821|google|pros|The products are world-class, the company culture is amazing, and the people are some of the smartest people you'll know.
821|google|cons|Like any organization, there are internal politics that need to be navigated. Some play this well, some don't. Making sure you align yourself on the right person's good side can be tricky.
822|google|pros|Best density of talent at any large company, their office productivity suite (e.g. gmail) is definitely the best, food is quite good, especially the coffee barista
822|google|cons|Google is now a bloated, political organization. Unless you are a software engineer you will learn more elsewhere, and have greater upside at a Facebook or a start-up. HQs are in MTV, outside of there your career stagnates.
823|google|pros|They do so much for the world. Amazing projects and initiatives taking place at the company.
823|google|cons|You are not always part of those projects and initiatives.
824|google|pros|It is great to work with smart coworkers. It saves a lot of time in making things clear. Most of the time communication is efficient, expect when there is conflicts among senior leaders.
824|google|cons|It is become bigger and layered. Most of the time you don't know which part you are working on within the huge system.
825|google|pros|benefits (plus four more words)
825|google|cons|no option to work from remote office
826|google|pros|- Talented Colleagues
826|google|cons|- Getting big
827|google|pros|- The people you work with! No matter what team you work on, you're going to work with lovely, interesting, and overall brilliant colleagues. The work itself and your clients are interesting and constantly changing. There is also the added benefit of plenty of opportunities for role changes and location changes all around the world
827|google|cons|- Work-life balance can vary significantly depending on what team you work on. Processes can be overly bureaucratic at times. The promotions process can be pretty opaque.
828|google|pros|great perks, great place to be
828|google|cons|politics, process now means that the company moves more slowly that before
829|google|pros|Challenging status quo and building software for a better tomorrow.
829|google|cons|No need to change a thing, and stay the same.
830|google|pros|Great perks, smart people, good pay
830|google|cons|So many politics, promotions based on popularity not aptitude.
831|google|pros|Justification to purchase tools for the work is quick and easy
831|google|cons|Not many experienced hardware engineers from the industry
832|google|pros|good atmosphere, team environment, hard work
832|google|cons|there were no cons ! great job!
833|google|pros|- nobody tells you what to do, you find your own problems and solve them
833|google|cons|- poor middle management in sales
834|google|pros|Google set the bar for what all companies should strive for regarding culture and benefits. But the true secret to Google's success is a management philosophy of hiring the best people and trusting them to do their own work without top down hierarchical direction.
834|google|cons|Google is very, very big. Because the size of the company is so vast it can sometimes be very difficult to get things done.
835|google|pros|Very smart people and flexibility to choose your projects, to choose your research areas. Overall I think my coworkers are extremely well qualified for their job.
835|google|cons|Internal code base is huge, it takes long time to get familiar with it. Promotion system is a bit flaky and is not refocused on impact rather than quality
836|google|pros|The salary is high; I couldn't make this much anywhere else.
836|google|cons|The company would like you to drink the Kool-Aid. I did in the beginning, and became disappointed by a lot of things. Now I look at Google as a big company that is doing it's best, and I do my best. I'm much happier now.
837|google|pros|Overall Google is a great company with lots of benefits such as free food, gym, paid internet, cell phone, lots of vacation and free transportation.
837|google|cons|The organization is very flat with lots of Type A personalities meaning that its pretty cut throat to move up.
838|google|pros|Google has amazing people working there, and they are eager to help you learn as much as possible. The other benefits are just icing on the cake.
838|google|cons|There are not that many women working at Google or in leadership positions there. This negatively affects the team dynamics, for both men and women. Women reading this - apply! Aim high! You can do it!
839|google|pros|Healthcare plan
839|google|cons|Lack of people development
840|google|pros|Awesome culture and co-workers. Really great work life balance.
840|google|cons|None. Google was an amazing place to work!
841|google|pros|Great perks, talented employees. Flexible hours, interesting projects - easy to move from team to team. Physical health prioritized with facilities on campus.
841|google|cons|Takes a while to get things done because of the size of the company you need to make sure noone else is working on what you're working on, and even if they are you can still do it anyway if you think you're better at politics.
842|google|pros|Great benefits and company culture.
842|google|cons|Lots of competition for positions and slow up-ward mobility
843|google|pros|Relaxing work environment.
843|google|cons|Many teams with uninteresting projects.
844|google|pros|* Google has, bar none, some of the best office schemes I've ever seen. Their conference room layouts make a lot of sense, and the designs and liveliness pouring through those walls were on another level.
844|google|cons|A lot of the cons below are projections of my experience at Google. Do a TON of research on the role you'll be applying for. Find people on LinkedIn. Scour reddit. Learn as much as you possibly can about what you'll be doing to try and prepare for what's to come.
845|google|pros|Entrepreneurial culture, very dynamic projects. The teams are made up of some of people with some of the most diverse backgrounds I have ever seen.
845|google|cons|Google is obviously a large company so sometimes it's difficult to feel your individual work is making a difference in the larger scope.
846|google|pros|Treat employees really well
846|google|cons|Nothing
847|google|pros|Great People. Great Culture. Great Benefits.
847|google|cons|Limited upward mobility in remote offices.
848|google|pros|Good pay
848|google|cons|Horrible systems
849|google|pros|Great opportunity for growth.
849|google|cons|Felt I was always competing.
850|google|pros|Work/life balance.
850|google|cons|Gained 20lbs.
851|google|pros|Fun great excellent amazing outstan
851|google|cons|Nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing
852|google|pros|Everything is great to work for google.
852|google|cons|Pay sucks and management is not very good with people.
853|google|pros|Google speaks for itself. Great resources, best minds in the world. Flat organization with high degree of autonomy
853|google|cons|Flat organization - leads to very autonomous environment.
854|google|pros|Excellent food and the location is good for many activities.
854|google|cons|Public transportation is not very convenient
855|google|pros|Huge level of responsibility and interesting work

864|google|pros|Super smart people, lots of free stuff. Amazing to work at Google, just to realize it's not all that.
864|google|cons|Workaholics, intense competition, constant game of thrones! Contractors are sort of a sub-class, make less money, have limited access to meetings, projects and facilities (for the same position).
865|google|pros|flexible works hours are the best
865|google|cons|One is expected to deliver the best
866|google|pros|Great co-workers, managers and projects.
866|google|cons|Can be bureaucratic at times due to the large size.
867|google|pros|Huge infrastructure for employee benefits. Low risk. Work with smart people. Free food is convenient and healthy. Buses make the commute more tolerable. People usually given a high degree of independence and trust.
867|google|cons|Senior leadership basically full with old timers. One-size fits all process and lack of transparency for benefits, promotions, and salary can be frustrating. Cultures vary widely from team to team in terms of diversity/bias, expected work hours, or positive energy.
868|google|pros|- high impact projects/teams
868|google|cons|- everyone is so smart, it's hard to stand out
869|google|pros|Great benefits, and get to work with some brilliant folk.
869|google|cons|After recent restructuring it will be difficult for people in the Alphabet companies to move about between projects, which will limit future opportunities. The interview process makes it difficult for good people to come in, outside of being acquired.

876|google|pros|Fun, caring, and overall great environment.
876|google|cons|Non-traditional sales roles that only use the complex AdWords platform
877|google|pros|I got to work with a fabulous team with excellent dynamics, doing interesting work. The support for interns was definitely there, the perks were out of this world, and almost anyone was open for reaching out and grabbing a cup of coffee with.
877|google|cons|You can end up feeling like an extremely minuscule part of the company, because the company is so large. I was definitely lucky and got a team that was top-notch and extremely welcoming to interns, but others might not be so fortunate. While my team dynamic was great, some other interns had less ideal experiences. Being at this internship can definitely spoil you for other places.
878|google|pros|the pros are that it's google
878|google|cons|the pros are that it's not microsoft
879|google|pros|Culture, Benefits, workplace, research job
879|google|cons|hard to show yourself among others to develop your career path
880|google|pros|Great colleagues, competitive pay, industry leading benefits, nimble for a large company. The company is pursuing very lofty goals and really leading the industry on a number of fronts. After 8 years, Google is still a great place to work and I can't imagine working for any other company. The only thing that could pull me away would be to start my own venture.
880|google|cons|Employees are almost exclusively from top tier universities and privileged backgrounds. Relative lack of intellectual and cultural diversity.
881|google|pros|Amazing perks and benefits
881|google|cons|Hard to get things done sometimes
882|google|pros|Great food, perks, lifestyle. Really smart people to learn from. Lots of cool projects to contribute to.
882|google|cons|Can get lost in the organization if you're not careful, some products seem to lack focus.
883|google|pros|Colleagues are smart, motivated, and nice. They keep me coming back. Vacation policy is pretty generous for US.
883|google|cons|The commute to Mountain View from San Francisco is horrific. Even if you work with people on the campus you may never see them due to sprawl and traffic.
884|google|pros|Wow I couldn't believe how amazing it was to work at Google. Amazing.
884|google|cons|It does get boring sometimes doing the same thing over and over again and it takes a long time to get things done.
885|google|pros|Good food, good people, good position and good techniques.
885|google|cons|I think they need more programmers to make every part of Google useful
886|google|pros|"Free food, adventure, proximity to ""Google"""
886|google|cons|dangerous, zero growth, time away from home, no benefits
887|google|pros|Great work-life balance. Very friendly and cooperative colleagues, partly due to the way we hand out promotions. Internally rather transparent and management seems to listen to what we want.
887|google|cons|There are many overqualified and hardworking people here. Just hard work alone will not get you anywhere. You need to source for good projects, work hard and smart in order to have decent career advancement.
888|google|pros|Many smart people and nice people. People are very understanding and helpful. Lots of opportunity to learn if you actually make the effort to do so.
888|google|cons|Since it is such a big company you can also get lost very easily. There are lots of custom proprietary tools that some people at Google only know how to use. And obviously that knowledge would be useless outside of Google. Understanding the interluding concepts is on the other hand useful.
889|google|pros|Everything is very very good
889|google|cons|I don't really have cons.
890|google|pros|This is one of the most inspiring companies I've been involved with - they have a mission to change the way children are educated and a clear vision for how to help

891|google|cons|hard for a returning full time offer
892|google|pros|Intellectual environment, fast paced and ambitious.

894|google|pros|People, perks, energy, and environment.
894|google|cons|Duplicative efforts / often reinventing the wheel.
895|google|pros|-99% of the people you work with are brilliant, but are also not jerks
895|google|cons|It's a big company, so you have to work harder to find opportunities to build new things. The nice thing is, the new things you build are built on top of the work of tons of brilliant people, so whatever you end up making will be very specialized and probably pretty awesome.
896|google|pros|culture, products, impact, people, fun
896|google|cons|large company, commute, spoiled me

903|google|pros|Coding workflow and tools are streamlined and integrated, allowing you to focus on codin, solving problems, and working with team members.
903|google|cons|You usually work on technically fairly small things because it's a giant company with a lot of resources.
904|google|pros|1) Open atmosphere and friendly coworkers
904|google|cons|Work could be stressful in some groups. I sometimes heard coworkers in some other groups talking about working overtime to get assignment done.
905|google|pros|I think it is fun and easy
905|google|cons|Not really any cons about working here
906|google|pros|Amazing team mates, great perks. Very fair in all processes

909|google|pros|money, money, money, money, money. and the free food. free trainings. money. I would have quit a long time ago were it not for the money.
909|google|cons|the politics, the pressure, the stress, the backstabbing, cutthroat colleagues, the lack of transparency, constant reorgs, lack of job security, the disposability of employees, lies from management. Human Resources team is a ship of fools.
910|google|pros|Amazing people to work with and learn from.
910|google|cons|None that I can think off. Well, maybe a long commute from the city.
911|google|pros|Culture has a noticeable focus on being nice to one another, get to work on exciting things
911|google|cons|Has gained a bit of bureaucracy around actually shipping software, but not too bad, and most of it is intended to prevent wild, west coding.
912|google|pros|clean environment nice work space
912|google|cons|too much work, lot of pressure
913|google|pros|You can learn a lot from internal materials if you want to. Great culture.
913|google|cons|Salary is fair. Work is not challenging enough. Experiences vary in different teams. Some teams are good while some teams are not.
914|google|pros|Well-paid, fun, everyone is friendly, work as much you want and can do, off site visits, it's Google!
914|google|cons|too many people, imposter-syndrome inducing, no symmetry is prohect complexity among interns on different teams, it's Google!
915|google|pros|great benefits, fun environment, job stability, working on amazing projects with smart people that impact the whole world
915|google|cons|"HUGE bureaucracy, with a company this big there is specialized roles and process for everything. Definitely not an ""intimate"" community and can take forever to get approvals for what seems the smallest thing."
916|google|pros|Ability to switch between multiple groups. Never gets boring.
916|google|cons|Management can sometimes get in the way of you doing things.

921|google|cons|Too large company, and you have to learn quickly
922|google|pros|Smartest collection of co-workers I've experienced
922|google|cons|Your experience may vary depending on team, manager etc.
923|google|pros|So much energy, very rewarding. Google is amazingly open and flexible. Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them).
923|google|cons|There are a lot of people working at Google, so the quality of your colleagues really varies.
924|google|pros|The pay is great, the benefits are second to none. Dev hardware is insane, production resources are seemingly unlimited.
924|google|cons|Competition is fierce among peers. Middle-management is hit-or-miss. The pace is grueling and relentless.

927|google|cons|No cons come to mind
928|google|pros|Benefits, variety of work, high learning curve
928|google|cons|Hard to move inside the org, very political and given its huge size it is much harder to grow in this company than elsewhere. Salaries might be amazing or terrible, and it all depends on the country, its taxes and your level in the company unfortunately, not the job.

934|google|pros|Google has excellent menu choices. The salary is high for a new grade. They have a very nice working environment.

935|google|cons|There are no major complaints.
936|google|pros|Free food, nice work environment and nice salary. And lots of opportunity to be exposed to new technology. And everyone is friendly
936|google|cons|tedious work, do the dame work everyday. Do not feel important in this company, the company runs the same way, with or without me.
937|google|pros|Perks and the culture of the company
937|google|cons|As a contractor, there is a pretty clear hierarchical thing working there. Some conferences and info are limited, and no freedom to do what you want.
938|google|pros|Awesome perks, I am happy whenever I work on site.
938|google|cons|More diversity would be nice
939|google|pros|Good company. Good benefits. Smart people
939|google|cons|Big company. Political. A lot of red tape
940|google|pros|Benefits are amazing.
940|google|cons|Little autonomy to get stuff done, difficult to get promotion, Henry Ford model of repetition being deployed all over
941|google|pros|I really enjoy working with my current team! Google, as everyone know, is a very innovative place and people thrive to invent new thing every day! I am glad to be part of the such successful company.
941|google|cons|I haven't yet seen any so far, especially in my roles.
942|google|pros|Gain in-depth technical skills working with highly competent and friendly coworkers.

948|google|pros|Food, laundry, gym, bikes... Free? Fun and challenging
948|google|cons|Contractors do feel not as welcomed
949|google|pros|The resident at the facility was very nice. My Co-workers were also nice. There was good teamwork even though we were short staff.
949|google|cons|The place smell like mold, the pay isn't enough, they tell you that your full-time and only put you on the schedule 1 or 2 days a week. The management sucks and their very unorganized.
950|google|pros|Great benefits and with okay salary for business side as well. Just a little bit down from management consulting firms. Once you are in the Google network, it will be easy for you to find jobs elsewhere too and the connections won't die after you leave.
950|google|cons|Could become a little bit political around promotion as most big companies. Job mobility can be attained around Mountainview but would be harder in other regions.
951|google|pros|Great place to work/perks/culture/fun/learning and very smart ambitious people to work with. Great name on your resume
951|google|cons|has become very political/career growth is much slower/comp is not great

952|google|cons|sometimes people come to google and think they're better than everyone else and that's not the spirit of google. sometimes people get self entitled and it stinks
953|google|pros|Decent pay and benefits, good bonuses and stock grants. Some really inspiring and talented coworkers. Learning opportunities. Some travel if you want it.
953|google|cons|I second the person who said Google protects bad managers. It seems like the more talented people leave and the less talented people get promoted (it's more about politics than talent).
954|google|pros|Wants their employees to be happy, will do anything and everything they can do make this happen.
954|google|cons|Large company, inherent bureaucracy, takes a lot of effort for changes to happen quickly.
955|google|pros|All expenses paid trip to Google HQ in Mountain View California

956|google|pros|Great Working Environment. Great Perks

960|google|pros|Competitive compensation. World renown perks. Very smart coworkers. Impactful projects.
960|google|cons|Working in Mountain View. Living nearby is undesirable, but living someplace desirable means a 90+ minute commute.

968|google|cons|overall Google's focus is on defending their cash cow; their other activities almost seem like they're just trying to keep talent off the market and away from competitors. that means if you're an engineer, you'll have a great time. but if you're a product-oriented person, caring about market success, customer satisfaction, etc, you'll get frustrated after a few years. top management is very split in it's priorities, … Show More

970|google|pros|The benefits are what you would dream of. Never pay for the dr again, eat anythign and everything you want. Smart people. Everything there just kind of 'works.' None of those annoying dead ends that other companies have.
970|google|cons|The sales org is huge. You can easily project your career growth, or lack there of. Very easy to look at your role today and map out the 24-36 month promotion cycle, with minimal fluctuation. Every year or so, some new person in upper management comes in wanting to make a name for themselves and re-orgs, which is a fancy way to say they just shuffle the deck, everyone is confused for a month or so, then people just g… Show More

982|google|pros|Good Training, lots of exposer, mentorship

984|google|cons|The actual work... it will probably suck. Don't be fooled. You will probably get told very little about your role before you start. Then you will spend a lot of time ramping up in your job, drinking from a hose, and one Sunday evening discover that the fit is bad and dread Monday morning.
